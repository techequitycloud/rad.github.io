# Admin User Guide

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Administrator Guide for the Rapid Application Deployment (RAD) platform. As an administrator, you have full control over the platform's configuration, user management, billing, and deployment oversight. This guide will walk you through your key responsibilities and the tools available to you.

## 2. Platform Setup & Global Configuration

The **Setup Menu** is your command center for configuring the platform's behavior. It is a one-time setup wizard that can be revisited whenever you need to change global settings.

### 2.1. Accessing Settings
Navigate to the **Setup Menu** link in the main navigation bar.

### 2.2. Key Configurations

*   **Deployment Scope:** Decide whether the platform operates at the Google Cloud **Organization** level or within a specific **Folder**. This determines the scope of data visible in reports and the target for deployments.
*   **Features:** Enable or disable major modules:
    *   **Enable Credits:** Turns on the credit-based cost management system.
    *   **Enable Subscription:** (Requires Credits) Activates the subscription tier system and Stripe integration.
    *   **Private Mode:**
        *   **Enabled:** Partners see *all* deployment data (like an admin). New users must be manually added to the Google Group.
        *   **Disabled (Default):** Partners only see their own data. New users can self-register.
*   **Notification Settings:** Configure the SMTP server settings and the "Support Email" address to enable email notifications for system events.
*   **Cleanup & Retention:** Set a **Retention Period** (e.g., 90 days) and a **Cleanup Schedule** (e.g., Daily) to automatically delete old deployment records and artifacts, helping you manage storage costs.

## 3. User Management

Manage your platform's users from the **Users** page (accessible via the main navigation).

### 3.1. Managing Users
*   **View Users:** See a list of all registered users.
*   **Activate/Deactivate:** Toggle the "Active" checkbox to grant or revoke login access. Deactivating a user removes them from all access groups.
*   **Assign Roles:**
    *   **Partner:** Grants access to the "Publish" tab for deploying private modules.
    *   **Agent:** Grants access to revenue reporting tools for referred users.
    *   **Finance:** Grants access to financial reports and invoices.
*   **Edit Credits:** Click "Edit" to manually adjust a user's "Awarded" or "Purchased" credit balance.

## 4. Credit & Billing Management

The **Billing** page is your financial hub. As an admin, you see comprehensive data for the entire platform.

### 4.1. Subscription Tiers
*   Go to the **Subscription Tiers** tab.
*   Here you can **Create**, **Edit**, and **Delete** the subscription packages available to users.
*   Define the Name, Price, Stripe Price ID, and Credit amount for each tier.

### 4.2. Credit Settings
*   Go to the **Credit Settings** tab to configure the economic model:
    *   **Price Per Credit:** Define the exchange rate (e.g., 100 credits = $1).
    *   **Sign-up Credits:** Set the number of free credits new users receive.
    *   **Global Adjustments:** Grant or remove credits from *all* users at once (e.g., for a promotion or correction).

### 4.3. Financial Reports
*   **Project Invoices:** View monthly cost breakdowns for every project in the organization.
*   **Project Costs:** Analyze historical spending trends across all deployments.
*   **Module Revenue:** See which modules are generating the most "true revenue" (paid for with purchased credits).
*   **User Revenue:** Track revenue generated by specific users or groups of users.
*   **Agent Revenue:** Monitor commissions and revenue driven by your Agents.

## 5. Managing Deployments

You have complete visibility into all activity on the platform.

*   **All Deployments:** On the **Deployments** page, the "All Deployments" tab shows every deployment ever created by any user.
*   **Delete Deployments:** You can delete any deployment to clean up resources.
*   **Logs & Debugging:** Click on any Deployment ID to view its full build logs, status history, and configuration variables. This is essential for troubleshooting user issues.

## 6. Publishing Platform Modules

You are responsible for the catalog of standard modules available to all users.

1.  **Configure Repo:** In your **Profile**, enter the GitHub URL and Access Token for the repository containing your Terraform modules.
2.  **Publish:** Go to the **Publish** page. You will see a list of modules found in your repo.
3.  **Select & Save:** Select the modules you want to make public and click "Publish" (or "Update"). These will immediately appear on the "Deploy" page for all users.

## 7. Support

Use the **Help** page to:
*   **Send Messages:** Broadcast messages to all users or specific groups via the "Send Message" form.
*   **Manage Documentation:** Ensure your users have access to the latest guides (like this one!).
