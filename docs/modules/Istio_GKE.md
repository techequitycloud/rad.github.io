# Istio on GKE

This module stands up a **GKE Standard cluster** and installs the **open-source Istio service mesh** onto it — the upstream CNCF project that underpins Google Cloud Service Mesh and many other managed mesh offerings. Istio is installed directly with `istioctl`, so every configuration decision is transparent and inspectable, making this an ideal hands-on environment for platform engineers learning how a service mesh works from the ground up.

At deploy time you choose one of two data-plane architectures: **sidecar mode** (an Envoy proxy injected into every pod for full per-pod traffic control) or **ambient mode** (a shared per-node `ztunnel` proxy plus optional waypoint proxies, with much lower resource overhead). Alongside Istio, the module installs the full open-source observability stack — **Prometheus, Jaeger, Grafana, and Kiali** — so you can explore mesh telemetry immediately. This is a standalone infrastructure module: it provisions its own VPC, cluster, and networking, and does not build on any shared foundation.

This module is intended for **educational and evaluation purposes**.

## 1. Overview

| Capability | Google Cloud service | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Compute | GKE Standard cluster | 2 × preemptible `e2-standard-2` nodes in a single node pool; you manage node configuration directly (not Autopilot) |
| Networking | VPC network + subnet | Custom-mode VPC, global routing, VPC-native (alias IP) with secondary ranges for pods and services |
| Egress | Cloud Router + Cloud NAT | Private nodes reach the internet (GitHub, container registries) through NAT during the Istio install |
| Identity | Workload Identity + dedicated node service account | Least-privilege node SA; pods get a GCP identity without key files |
| Service mesh | Open-source Istio (via `istioctl`) | Sidecar **or** ambient mode, plus an Istio Ingress Gateway exposed via an external LoadBalancer |
| Observability | Prometheus, Jaeger, Grafana, Kiali | In-cluster open-source add-ons installed into `istio-system`; GKE Managed Prometheus also enabled at the cluster level |
| Security posture | GKE Security Posture, Gateway API | BASIC posture + vulnerability scanning; Gateway API standard channel enabled |

**Things to know up front:**

- **GKE Standard, not Autopilot.** You control the node pool, machine type, and cluster settings directly. The cluster permits the `NET_ADMIN` capability, which sidecar mode needs for its traffic-interception setup.
- **Sidecar is the default.** `install_ambient_mesh` defaults to `false` (sidecar mode). Set it to `true` for ambient mode. The mode is chosen at deploy time, and switching it requires a redeploy.
- **The Istio install runs as a deploy-time step.** After the cluster is created, the platform downloads `istioctl`, installs Istio with the selected profile, labels the `default` namespace for mesh enrolment, and installs the four observability add-ons. Transient add-on failures are logged as warnings and do not fail the deploy.
- **The Ingress Gateway gets a public IP.** Both modes install an `istio-ingressgateway` Service of type `LoadBalancer`, which provisions a GCP external load balancer. Allow 1–2 minutes after install for the IP to be assigned.
- **No demo application is provisioned.** The mesh and observability stack are installed, but no sample workload is deployed by the module. To explore traffic management you deploy your own workloads (or the Istio Bookinfo sample) into the `default` namespace, which is already labelled for mesh enrolment.
- **Preemptible nodes.** Nodes can be reclaimed with ~30 seconds notice. This keeps costs low for a learning environment but is not suitable for production.

## 2. Google Cloud Services & How to Explore Them

All `kubectl` / `istioctl` commands assume you have fetched cluster credentials first (the exact command is returned in the `cluster_credentials_cmd` [output](#5-outputs)):

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <gke_cluster> --region <region> --project <project>
```

### A. GKE Standard cluster

The cluster runs a single node pool of two preemptible `e2-standard-2` nodes with VPC-native networking, Workload Identity, GKE Security Posture (BASIC), Managed Prometheus, and the Gateway API standard channel enabled.

- **Console:** Kubernetes Engine → Clusters → select the cluster → Details (release channel, version), Nodes (node pool), Security (Workload Identity, Security Posture).
- **CLI:**
  ```bash
  gcloud container clusters describe <gke_cluster> --region <region> --project <project> \
    --format="value(currentMasterVersion,releaseChannel.channel)"
  kubectl get nodes -o wide
  kubectl top nodes
  ```

### B. VPC networking, firewall, and Cloud NAT

A custom-mode VPC with one subnet (secondary ranges for pods and services), firewall rules, and a Cloud Router + Cloud NAT for outbound egress. The Istio install depends on NAT to download `istioctl` and add-on manifests.

- **Console:** VPC network → VPC networks (subnet + secondary ranges); VPC network → Firewall; Network services → Cloud NAT.
- **CLI:**
  ```bash
  gcloud compute networks subnets describe <subnet_name> --region <region> --project <project>
  gcloud compute firewall-rules list --project <project>
  gcloud compute routers get-nat-mapping-info cr1-<region> --region <region> --project <project>
  ```

### C. Istio control plane

`istiod` (the unified Pilot / Citadel / Galley control plane) and the Istio Ingress Gateway run in the `istio-system` namespace. `istiod` pushes Envoy/ztunnel configuration via the xDS protocol and acts as the mesh certificate authority.

- **Console:** Kubernetes Engine → Workloads → filter namespace `istio-system`.
- **CLI:**
  ```bash
  kubectl get all -n istio-system
  istioctl version
  istioctl verify-install
  istioctl proxy-status            # all proxies synced to the control plane
  istioctl analyze -A              # configuration validation
  ```

### D. Data plane — sidecar vs ambient

In **sidecar mode** an Envoy proxy is injected into each pod in a namespace labelled `istio-injection=enabled` (the module labels `default`). In **ambient mode** a `ztunnel` DaemonSet handles L4 mTLS per node for namespaces labelled `istio.io/dataplane-mode=ambient`, with optional waypoint proxies for L7.

- **CLI (sidecar):**
  ```bash
  kubectl get namespace default --show-labels        # expect istio-injection=enabled
  kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration | grep istio
  istioctl proxy-config all <pod>                    # Envoy config for a pod's sidecar
  ```
- **CLI (ambient):**
  ```bash
  kubectl get namespace default --show-labels        # expect istio.io/dataplane-mode=ambient
  kubectl get daemonset ztunnel -n istio-system
  kubectl get pods -n istio-system -l app=ztunnel -o wide
  istioctl ztunnel-config workloads
  ```

### E. Istio Ingress Gateway

A standalone Envoy `Deployment` fronted by a `LoadBalancer` Service that provisions a GCP external load balancer — the entry point for traffic into the mesh.

- **Console:** Kubernetes Engine → Service & Ingress → `istio-ingressgateway`; Network services → Load balancing.
- **CLI:**
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system
  # Read the external IP from the Service (the external_ip output is not reliably populated):
  kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system \
    -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'; echo
  ```

### F. Observability stack

Prometheus, Jaeger, Grafana, and Kiali are installed into `istio-system`. They are reached by port-forwarding (the module does not expose them externally). GKE Managed Prometheus runs alongside them at the cluster level.

- **Console:** Monitoring → Metrics Explorer (Managed Prometheus / PromQL); Kubernetes Engine → Workloads (`istio-system`) for the add-on pods.
- **CLI:**
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n istio-system -l 'app in (prometheus,grafana,jaeger,kiali)'
  kubectl port-forward svc/kiali 20001:20001 -n istio-system        # http://localhost:20001
  kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:3000 -n istio-system        # http://localhost:3000
  kubectl port-forward svc/tracing 16686:80 -n istio-system         # Jaeger UI
  kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus 9090:9090 -n istio-system
  ```

### G. Cloud Logging & Monitoring

Cluster system and workload logs flow to Cloud Logging; cluster and Managed Prometheus metrics flow to Cloud Monitoring.

- **Console:** Logging → Logs Explorer; Monitoring → Dashboards (GKE / Kubernetes).
- **CLI:**
  ```bash
  gcloud logging read 'resource.type="k8s_container" AND resource.labels.namespace_name="istio-system"' \
    --project <project> --limit 50
  ```

## 3. Behaviour

**Deploy-time sequence:**

1. Enable the required project APIs and wait for the Container API to activate.
2. Create the VPC, subnet (with pod and service secondary ranges), firewall rules, and Cloud Router + Cloud NAT — unless `create_network = false`, in which case the named existing network and subnet are used.
3. Create the GKE Standard cluster and a two-node preemptible node pool with a dedicated least-privilege node service account — unless `create_cluster = false`, in which case Istio installs onto the named existing cluster.
4. Run the Istio install as a deploy-time step: download `istioctl` for the requested `istio_version`, fetch cluster credentials, create the `istio-system` namespace, and install Istio with the selected profile.
5. Label the `default` namespace for mesh enrolment, then install the Prometheus, Jaeger, Grafana, and Kiali add-ons and run an installation verification.

**Sidecar mode (`install_ambient_mesh = false`, default):**

- Istio is installed with mesh identifiers and an autoscaled Ingress Gateway (min 2 / max 5 replicas, CPU target 80%). If that install path fails, the step falls back to a `minimal` profile install.
- The `default` namespace is labelled `istio-injection=enabled`. Pods created there receive an Envoy `istio-proxy` sidecar; the cluster permits `NET_ADMIN` so the sidecar can program traffic interception. **Existing pods must be restarted to pick up a sidecar.**

**Ambient mode (`install_ambient_mesh = true`):**

- Istio is installed with the `ambient` profile plus a LoadBalancer Ingress Gateway, and a resource quota is applied to protect node-critical pods.
- A `ztunnel` DaemonSet provides per-node L4 mTLS. The `default` namespace is labelled `istio.io/dataplane-mode=ambient` and a waypoint proxy is applied to it for L7 policy. Enrolment requires **no pod restart**.

**Runtime notes:**

- **Ingress IP.** After install, the Ingress Gateway's external IP takes 1–2 minutes to appear. The deploy logs print it; read it any time with `kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system`. The module's `external_ip` output is best-effort and commonly reports `IP not available` — use the Service instead.
- **No sample application.** Although a `deploy_application` toggle is present, the current module does not provision a demo workload. Deploy your own services (or the Istio Bookinfo sample bundled with the downloaded Istio release) into the already-labelled `default` namespace to exercise traffic management, mTLS, and authorization policies.
- **Permissive mTLS by default.** The mesh accepts both plaintext and mTLS traffic until you apply a `STRICT` `PeerAuthentication` policy — intentional for incremental adoption.
- **Teardown.** Destroy runs a graceful uninstall that removes waypoints/labels, the observability add-ons, the Istio installation, and the `istio-system` namespace before the cluster and network are torn down. Cleanup steps are best-effort and never block the destroy.

## 4. Configuration Variables

Grouped exactly as they appear on the deployment platform. Module-metadata settings (Group 0) are managed by the platform and are not shown here.

### Group 1 — Project & Region

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `project_id` | _(required)_ | Destination GCP project where the cluster and mesh are deployed. Must already exist. |
| `region` | `us-central1` | Region for the cluster, VPC, and all regional resources. Ensure sufficient quota. |

### Group 2 — Network

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `create_network` | `true` | Create a new VPC and subnet. Set `false` to install into an existing network/subnet. |
| `network_name` | `vpc-network` | Name of the VPC — created when `create_network = true`, otherwise the existing network to use. |
| `subnet_name` | `vpc-subnet` | Name of the subnet — created or referenced depending on `create_network`. |
| `ip_cidr_ranges` | `["10.132.0.0/16", "192.168.1.0/24"]` | CIDR blocks for the subnet ranges (only used when creating a network). The first is the primary node range. |

### Group 3 — GKE Cluster

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `create_cluster` | `true` | Create a new GKE Standard cluster. Set `false` to install Istio onto an existing cluster. |
| `gke_cluster` | `gke-cluster` | Name of the cluster — created or referenced depending on `create_cluster`. |
| `release_channel` | `REGULAR` | GKE release channel: `RAPID`, `REGULAR`, `STABLE`, or `NONE` (manual upgrades). |
| `pod_cidr_block` | `10.62.128.0/17` | Secondary range for pod IPs. Must not overlap the node or service ranges. |
| `service_cidr_block` | `10.64.128.0/20` | Secondary range for Service ClusterIPs. Must not overlap the node or pod ranges. |

### Group 4 — Istio Features

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `istio_version` | `1.24.2` | Open-source Istio version to install (major.minor.patch). Must be supported by the chosen release channel. |
| `install_ambient_mesh` | `false` | `false` installs sidecar mode (Envoy per pod); `true` installs ambient mode (per-node ztunnel + optional waypoints). |

---

## 5. Outputs

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| `deployment_id` | The deployment ID (random suffix) used to make resource names unique. |
| `project_id` | The destination project ID. |
| `cluster_credentials_cmd` | Ready-to-run `gcloud container clusters get-credentials` command for the cluster. |
| `external_ip` | Best-effort Istio Ingress Gateway external IP. Frequently reports `IP not available` — read the IP from the `istio-ingressgateway` Service instead. |

---

## 6. Configuration Pitfalls & Sensible Defaults

> Risk: **Critical** (data loss / outage / security) — **High** (service degraded) —
> **Medium** (cost or partial degradation) — **Low** (minor).

| Setting | Sensible value | Risk | Consequence if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pod_cidr_block` / `service_cidr_block` / `ip_cidr_ranges` | non-overlapping ranges | Critical | Overlapping secondary ranges (with each other or peered/on-prem networks) break cluster creation or cause routing conflicts that are hard to undo. |
| `install_ambient_mesh` | chosen once at deploy | High | The mode is fixed at install time; switching between sidecar and ambient after deploy requires tearing the mesh down and reinstalling. |
| `istio_version` | a real released tag (e.g. `1.24.2`) | High | An unavailable or unsupported version fails the `istioctl` download/install, leaving the cluster without a mesh. |
| `create_cluster` / `gke_cluster` | match the real target | High | With `create_cluster = false`, an incorrect `gke_cluster` name fails the existing-cluster lookup and the install aborts. |
| `create_network` with existing network | correct `network_name` / `subnet_name` | High | A wrong existing network/subnet name fails the lookup, or places the cluster in an unintended network. |
| Ingress IP expectations | read from the Service, not `external_ip` | Medium | Relying on the `external_ip` output (often `IP not available`) causes confusion; the LoadBalancer IP is always on the `istio-ingressgateway` Service. |
| `release_channel` | `REGULAR` | Medium | `RAPID` pulls in early Kubernetes versions that may not be validated against the chosen `istio_version`; `NONE` disables automatic patching. |
| Preemptible nodes (fixed) | acceptable for labs only | Medium | Both nodes can be reclaimed simultaneously, briefly making the control plane and gateway unavailable. Not for production. |
| Expecting a built-in demo app | deploy your own workload | Low | The module installs the mesh only; nothing serves traffic until you deploy a workload into the `default` namespace. |
