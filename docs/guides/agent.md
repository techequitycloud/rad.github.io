## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Agent Program! As an Agent, you earn commissions by referring new users to the platform. This guide explains how to track your referrals and monitor the revenue they generate.

## 2. Referring Users

1.  **Get Your Link:** Go to the **Help** page and select the **Support** tab.
    *   *Note: This feature is only visible if enabled by the administrator.*
2.  **Invite User:** You will see your unique **Referral Link** (e.g., `?ref=YOUR_ID`) and a QR code.
3.  **Share:** Send this link to potential users. When they sign up using your link, they are automatically linked to your account as a "Referred User".

## 3. Tracking Revenue

Your revenue dashboard is located on the **Revenue** page (click "Revenue" in the top navigation). You have access to two special tabs to monitor your earnings.

### 3.1. User Revenue Tab
This detailed report shows you exactly *who* is generating revenue.
*   **Filters:** Filter by specific users (multiselect) and date range.
*   **Data Points:** View the User Email, Module Name, Created At date, Credit Cost, and the **True Revenue** generated (cost paid with purchased credits).
*   **Commission:** Your commission is calculated as a percentage of this revenue.

### 3.2. Module Revenue Tab
This report gives you a view of *what* is selling across your referrals.
*   **Filters:** Filter by Module Name and date range.
*   **Data Points:** View Module Name, Created At date, Credit Cost, and Revenue.
*   **Insight:** Use this to understand which products are most popular among your referrals so you can focus your marketing efforts.

### 3.3. Additive Role
Note that your Agent role is **additive**. You still have all the features of a standard user (deploying modules, buying credits) plus these extra reporting tools.
