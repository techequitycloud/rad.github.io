# Credit Management

The **Credit Management** tab (labeled "Credit Management" or "User Management" in the UI) allows Administrators and Finance users to manage user credit balances. This includes awarding free credits or manually adjusting purchased credits.

## Features

*   **Search Users:** Find users by email.
*   **View Balances:** See the current `Credit Awards` (free credits) and `Credit Purchases` (paid credits) for a user.
*   **Adjust Credits:**
    *   **Award Credits:** Grant free credits to a user. These are typically used for trials, grants, or compensation.
    *   **Adjust Purchases:** Manually add or remove purchased credits. This is useful for correcting billing issues or handling manual payments.
*   **Reset Balances:** Reset a user's credit balance to zero.

## How to Use

1.  Navigate to the **Billing** page and click on the **Credit Management** tab.
2.  **Select a User:**
    *   Use the search bar to find a user by their email address.
    *   Select the user from the dropdown list.
3.  **View Current Balance:** The user's current Awarded and Purchased credit balances will be displayed.
4.  **Adjust Balance:**
    *   Enter a positive or negative number in the **Amount** field.
    *   Select the **Type** of credit: "Award" or "Purchase".
    *   Click **Update Balance**.
5.  **Verification:** The system will confirm the transaction and update the displayed balance.

## Important Notes

*   **Audit Trail:** All manual credit adjustments are logged.
*   **Notifications:** Users may receive an email notification when their credit balance is adjusted.
*   **Credit Priority:** When a user deploys a module, credits are deducted based on the module's configuration. Typically, awarded credits are used first unless the module requires purchased credits.
