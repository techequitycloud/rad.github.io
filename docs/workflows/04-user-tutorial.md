## 1. Introduction
Welcome to the platform! This tutorial covers the core actions you'll perform as a user: deploying applications, managing them, and tracking your credits.

## 2. Step 1: Deploy a Module
The core feature of the platform is deploying pre-configured software modules.

1.  Click **Deploy** in the top navigation bar.
2.  **Find a Module:**
    *   Browse the **Platform Modules** tab for public modules.
    *   Use the search bar to find modules by name.
    *   If you have access to partner-specific modules, click the **Partner Modules** tab.
3.  **Start Deployment:**
    *   Click on a module card to start the configuration process.
    *   Fill in the required variables (e.g., project name, region).
    *   Review the estimated cost (if credits are enabled).
    *   Click **Deploy** to launch your application.

## 3. Step 2: Manage Your Deployments
Once you've deployed a module, you can monitor and manage it.

1.  Click **Deployments** in the navigation bar.
2.  **View Status:**
    *   You will see a list of your deployments with their current status (e.g., `CREATING`, `ACTIVE`, `FAILED`).
    *   Use the search bar to find specific deployments by name or ID.
3.  **View Details & Logs:**
    *   Click on any deployment row to expand it.
    *   You can view detailed build logs to troubleshoot issues or verify success.
4.  **Delete a Deployment:**
    *   If you no longer need an application, click the trash icon (Delete) to remove it and stop any associated costs.

## 4. Step 3: Manage Credits & Costs
If your platform uses a credit system, you'll need to manage your balance.

1.  Click **Credits** in the navigation bar.
2.  **Check Balance:** Your current balance is displayed in the top header stats or on this page.
3.  **Buy Credits (if enabled):**
    *   Click the **Buy Credits** tab (only visible if subscriptions are enabled).
    *   Choose a subscription plan or purchase a one-time credit bundle.
4.  **Review Transactions:**
    *   The **Credit Transactions** tab shows a history of your spending.
    *   You can see exactly how many credits were spent on each deployment.
    *   Click **Export CSV** to download a report for your records.

## 5. Step 4: Get Help
Need assistance or more detailed guides?

1.  Click **Help** in the navigation bar.
2.  **Read Guides:** Access the **User Guide** tab for detailed documentation.
3.  **Contact Support:**
    *   Click the **Support** tab.
    *   Fill out the support form to send a message directly to the admin team.
    *   **Invite Friends:** (If enabled) Use the "Invite Friends" card to copy your referral link or scan the QR code to invite new users.
