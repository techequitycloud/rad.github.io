# Tutorial: Getting Started

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to the Rapid Application Deployment (RAD) platform! This tutorial will guide you through your first steps: logging in, exploring the dashboard, and deploying your first module.

## 2. Step 1: Login
1.  Navigate to the application URL.
2.  Click the **"Sign in with Google"** button.
3.  Enter your Google credentials.
4.  **Success!** You will be redirected to the **Deployments** page.
    *   *Tip:* If you are a new user, check your notification area—you might have received free "Sign-up Credits"!

## 3. Step 2: Explore the Dashboard
The **Deployments** page is your main hub.
*   **My Deployments:** This list is currently empty. It will show your apps once you deploy them.
*   **Navigation Bar:**
    *   **Deploy:** Go here to launch new apps.
    *   **Billing:** Manage your credits.
    *   **Help:** Find guides and support.

## 4. Step 3: Deploy a Module
Let's launch your first application.

1.  Click **Deploy** in the top navigation.
2.  Browse the cards. Look for a module labeled **"Simple Website"** (or similar).
3.  Click the card.
4.  **Configure:** You'll see a form.
    *   Enter a unique **Project ID**.
    *   Select a **Region** (e.g., `us-central1`).
5.  Click **Submit**.
6.  **Confirm:** Review the credit cost on the popup modal and click **Confirm**.

## 5. Step 4: Monitor Progress
You are now back on the **Deployments** page.
1.  Find your new deployment in the list.
2.  Status should be `QUEUED` or `PROVISIONING`.
3.  **Click the ID:** Open the details view.
4.  **Watch Logs:** You can see the real-time logs as the system builds your app.
5.  Wait for the status to turn green: **`SUCCESS`**.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your first module.
