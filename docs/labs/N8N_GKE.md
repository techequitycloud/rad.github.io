# N8N on GKE Autopilot — Lab Guide

📖 **[Configuration Guide](https://docs.radmodules.dev/docs/modules/N8N_GKE)**

## Overview

**Estimated time:** 45–90 minutes

n8n is a fair-code workflow automation platform with a visual canvas editor, 400+
integrations, webhook triggers, and a built-in task scheduler. This lab takes you
through the full operational lifecycle of the **N8N on GKE Autopilot** module on
Google Cloud: deploy it, access and verify it, run it day-to-day, observe it,
diagnose common problems, and tear it down.

The lab focuses on operating the **GKE module and the Google Cloud platform**, not on
n8n product features. For the complete list of provisioned services and every
configuration input (organised by group), see the
[Configuration Guide](https://docs.radmodules.dev/docs/modules/N8N_GKE) — this
lab deliberately does not duplicate that detail so it stays accurate over time.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab you will be able to:

- Deploy the module from the RAD platform and locate the resources it provisions.
- Connect to the GKE cluster and access the running workload.
- Perform day-2 operations — inspect, scale, update, and manage secrets and storage.
- Observe the workload with Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring.
- Diagnose and resolve the most common deployment and runtime issues.
- Tear the deployment down cleanly.

## Prerequisites

- **Services_GCP deployed** in the target project (provides the VPC, GKE Autopilot
  cluster, Cloud SQL, Artifact Registry, and shared service accounts this module
  depends on).
- A Google Cloud project with **billing enabled**.
- **gcloud CLI** and **kubectl** installed; `gcloud auth login` and
  `gcloud auth application-default login` completed.
- **Project Owner** (or equivalent) IAM on the project.
- **RAD platform access** with permission to deploy modules into the project.

Set these shell variables once; every task below reuses them:

```bash
export PROJECT="<your-gcp-project-id>"
export REGION="us-central1"           # the region you deploy into
```

---

## Task 1 — Deploy the module [Automated]

1. Click **Deploy** in the RAD platform top navigation, open **N8N (GKE)** from the **Platform Modules** list to start configuration, set `project_id`, and review the inputs.
   Configure only what you need — the
   [Configuration Guide](https://docs.radmodules.dev/docs/modules/N8N_GKE)
   documents every input by group, with defaults. Review the estimated cost (if credits are enabled) and click **Deploy**, which opens the deployment status page with real-time logs.

2. The platform deploys the workload into the GKE Autopilot cluster, provisions a
   Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL 15) database with its Secret Manager secrets, a Filestore
   NFS share for binary file storage, an optional Redis endpoint, builds the
   container image, and runs a one-shot database-initialisation job. First deploys
   take roughly **20–35 minutes** (Cloud SQL creation dominates).

3. Connect to the cluster and discover the namespace with name-agnostic filters:

   ```bash
   CLUSTER=$(gcloud container clusters list --project="$PROJECT" --format="value(name)" --limit=1)
   gcloud container clusters get-credentials "$CLUSTER" --region="$REGION" --project="$PROJECT"

   NS=$(kubectl get ns -o name | grep n8n | head -1 | cut -d/ -f2)
   echo "Cluster: $CLUSTER   Namespace: $NS"
   kubectl get all -n "$NS"
   ```

---

## Task 2 — Access & verify [Manual]

1. Confirm the workload is running and find its external address:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods,svc -n "$NS"
   EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get svc -n "$NS" \
     -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.spec.type=="LoadBalancer")].status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
   echo "External IP: $EXTERNAL_IP"
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "http://${EXTERNAL_IP}:5678/"
   # expect 200 (or 301/302 redirect to the login or setup page)
   ```

2. Open `http://${EXTERNAL_IP}:5678` in a browser. On first launch n8n prompts you
   to create an owner account — enter your email and a strong password to complete
   setup. The n8n encryption key is stored in Secret Manager; the admin account
   credentials are stored in the PostgreSQL database and are not retrievable from
   Secret Manager.

   To confirm the encryption key secret exists:

   ```bash
   gcloud secrets list --project="$PROJECT" --filter="name~n8n-encryption-key"
   ```

---

## Task 3 — Operate & keep it running (Day-2) [Manual]

1. **Inspect the workload** — deployment, pods, and (if enabled) the horizontal
   autoscaler and persistent volumes:

   ```bash
   kubectl get deploy,pods,hpa,pvc -n "$NS"
   kubectl describe deploy -n "$NS"
   ```

2. **Scale** by changing the min/max instance inputs and clicking **Update** on the deployment details page —
   the module owns the workload spec, so scaling is a configuration change, not a
   manual `kubectl scale` (a manual edit would be reverted on the next apply). The
   HPA autoscales between those bounds based on CPU utilisation; session affinity
   (`ClientIP`) keeps editor WebSocket sessions pinned to a single pod.

3. **Update the application version** by changing the version input in the RAD platform
   and applying it via **Update**; a new image builds and a rolling update replaces the pods.

4. **Manage secrets, storage, and jobs:**

   ```bash
   kubectl get secrets -n "$NS"
   gcloud secrets list --project="$PROJECT" --filter="name~n8n"
   kubectl get jobs -n "$NS"          # db-init and any scheduled jobs
   ```

5. **Open a database session** for inspection or maintenance:

   ```bash
   INSTANCE=$(gcloud sql instances list --project="$PROJECT" --format="value(name)" --limit=1)
   gcloud sql connect "$INSTANCE" --user=n8n_user --project="$PROJECT"
   ```

---

## Task 4 — Observe: Logging & Monitoring [Manual]

1. **Logs** — from `kubectl` or the Logs Explorer:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n "$NS" deploy/"$(kubectl get deploy -n "$NS" -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')" --tail=50
   ```

   Logs Explorer filter:
   `resource.type="k8s_container" AND resource.labels.namespace_name="<namespace>"`.

2. **Monitoring** — open the GKE / Kubernetes dashboards and review pod CPU and memory
   utilisation, restart counts, and HPA scaling events. The module also provisions an
   **uptime check** (when enabled); review Monitoring → Uptime checks and
   Alerting → Policies.

---

## Task 5 — Troubleshoot & debug [Manual]

Durable techniques for the failure modes you are most likely to hit. These are
platform-level diagnostics and do not change with n8n releases.

- **Pod not Ready / CrashLoopBackOff:** inspect events and logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod -n "$NS" <pod>          # Events section shows scheduling/probe/mount errors
  kubectl logs -n "$NS" <pod> --previous       # logs from the crashed container
  ```
- **Database connection errors:** confirm the Cloud SQL instance is `RUNNABLE`, the
  DB password secret materialised into the namespace, and the init job completed. The
  n8n container translates the platform-injected `DB_*` variables to n8n-native
  `DB_POSTGRESDB_*` at startup; a missing or incorrect variable will surface here.
- **Initialisation job failed:** inspect the job and its pod logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl get jobs -n "$NS"
  kubectl logs -n "$NS" job/<job-name>
  ```
- **Pending pod / no external IP:** check `kubectl describe pod` events for resource
  or quota issues, and confirm the LoadBalancer Service has an assigned IP.
- **Image pull errors:** confirm the image exists in Artifact Registry and the node
  service account can pull it.
- **Encryption key issues:** the `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` secret must not be rotated or
  deleted — doing so permanently corrupts all saved workflow credentials. Confirm the
  secret version is `ENABLED`.

See the Configuration Guide's *Configuration Pitfalls* section for setting-specific
gotchas.

## Task 6 — Tear down [Automated]

On the **Deployments** page, open the deployment and click the **Trash** icon (**Delete**). Delete runs `terraform destroy` and is irreversible (the deployment record is retained for history). If a deployment is stuck and the RAD platform can no longer manage it (for example after manual changes that conflict with the Terraform state), use **Purge** instead — it removes the deployment from RAD's records **without** destroying the cloud resources (it makes RAD forget the project). This removes everything the module created — the Kubernetes workload
and namespace, Cloud SQL database, Secret Manager secrets, GCS buckets, Filestore NFS
share, and Artifact Registry images. Resources owned by **Services_GCP** (the VPC,
GKE cluster, shared Cloud SQL, registry) are managed separately and are not removed
here.
