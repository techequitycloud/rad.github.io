# Project Costs (User View)

The **Project Costs** tab allows users to view the underlying infrastructure costs of their deployments. While you pay in "Credits," this view shows the estimated cloud provider cost (e.g., in USD) for the resources running in your projects.

## Features

*   **Cost Transparency:** See the estimated cloud cost of your deployments.
*   **Breakdown by Project:** If you have multiple projects, costs are grouped by Project ID.
*   **Date Filtering:** View costs for a specific date range.

## How to Use

1.  Navigate to the **Credits** page and click on the **Project Costs** tab.
2.  Select a date range if necessary.
3.  Review the cost estimates.

## Note

*   These costs are estimates based on standard cloud pricing and your usage.
*   Your actual credit consumption is determined by the **Module Price** set by the module author, which may differ from the raw infrastructure cost.
