# MC_Bank_GKE Module

## Overview

The **MC_Bank_GKE** module deploys a production-grade, multi-cluster microservices banking application on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). It is designed as a comprehensive learning environment for platform engineers who want to gain hands-on experience with advanced GKE capabilities, including multi-cluster networking, service mesh, global load balancing, and cloud-native observability.

The application deployed is **Bank of Anthos** — an open-source, HTTP-based banking simulation built by Google Cloud Platform. It consists of nine microservices written in Python and Java, communicating over a service mesh, and exposed to the internet via a globally distributed load balancer with automatic TLS certificate management.

This module is intended for **educational purposes**. It is not a production banking system. Its value lies in the breadth and depth of Google Cloud and Kubernetes features it exercises simultaneously in a realistic, working application context.

## Architecture Overview

The module creates the following high-level architecture:

```

    ▼
Global External Load Balancer (Google Cloud)
    │  ┌─ HTTPS redirect (HTTP 301)
    │  ├─ Google-managed TLS certificate

(us-west1)             (us-east1)
    │                      │
    └──── GKE Fleet ───────┘
              │
              ├─ Cloud Service Mesh (ASM)
              ├─ Multi-Cluster Services
              └─ Shared Fleet Config
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Multi-region placement**: Clusters are distributed across two GCP regions by default (us-west1 and us-east1). This mirrors a real high-availability deployment where workloads survive a regional failure.

**Single global VPC**: All clusters share one VPC network with GLOBAL routing mode. Each cluster has its own subnet with dedicated secondary IP ranges for pods and services, preventing address conflicts.

**Config cluster pattern**: Multi-Cluster Ingress is configured from `cluster1`, which acts as the configuration cluster. The GKE Hub multi-cluster ingress feature uses this cluster as the authoritative source for ingress configuration and distributes it across the fleet.

**Automatic service mesh**: Cloud Service Mesh is enabled at the fleet level with `MANAGEMENT_AUTOMATIC` mode. GKE manages the control plane, upgrades, and lifecycle of the mesh without manual intervention.

**Namespace as mesh boundary**: The `bank-of-anthos` namespace is labelled with `istio.io/rev=asm-managed` on both clusters, which triggers automatic Envoy sidecar injection into every pod in that namespace.

## GKE Cluster Features

### Autopilot vs Standard Clusters

This module supports both GKE **Autopilot** and **Standard** cluster modes, selectable at deployment time. Autopilot is the default.

| Feature | Autopilot | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Node management | Fully managed by Google | Self-managed node pools |
| Node provisioning | Automatic, per-pod | Manual or cluster autoscaler |
| Pricing model | Per-pod resource usage | Per-node (always-on) |
| Spot/preemptible nodes | Supported via pod config | Spot nodes configured in node pool |
| Workload Identity | Enabled automatically | Must be explicitly enabled |
| Security hardening | Enforced by default | Configurable |
| Best for | Simplicity and cost efficiency | Maximum control and customisation |

In **Standard mode**, this module provisions node pools with the following defaults:
- **Machine type**: `e2-standard-2` (2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM)
- **Disk**: 50 GB SSD (`pd-ssd`)
- **Spot instances**: enabled — nodes are preemptible, reducing cost by up to 80%, appropriate for a learning environment
- **Node count**: 2 nodes per pool, spread across available zones in the region

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Kubernetes Engine → Clusters** to see all clusters, their mode (Autopilot/Standard), version, and node count. Click a cluster name and select the **Nodes** tab to see individual node status, machine type, and zone placement.

**Inspect via CLI:**
```bash
# List all clusters with mode and version
gcloud container clusters list --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format="table(name,location,autopilot.enabled,currentMasterVersion,status)"

# Describe a cluster to see full configuration
gcloud container clusters describe gke-cluster-1 \
  --region us-west1 --project PROJECT_ID

# List node pools (Standard clusters only)
gcloud container node-pools list \
  --cluster gke-cluster-1 \
  --region us-west1 --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format="table(name,config.machineType,config.spot,initialNodeCount,status)"

# View all nodes and their status
kubectl get nodes --context $CTX1 -o wide
```

### Release Channel

Clusters are enrolled in the **REGULAR release channel**. GKE release channels automate cluster upgrades and ensure nodes and control planes stay on a supported, tested version.

| Channel | Update cadence | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| RAPID | Immediately after release | Feature testing, dev environments |
| REGULAR | 2–4 weeks after RAPID | Most production workloads |
| STABLE | 2–4 weeks after REGULAR | Risk-averse, compliance-sensitive workloads |
| EXTENDED | Up to 24 months support | Long-running, infrequently updated clusters |

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Kubernetes Engine → Clusters → (cluster name) → Details** and look for the **Release channel** field. The console also shows the current master version and the next available upgrade version.

**Inspect via CLI:**
```bash
# Check release channel and current version for all clusters
gcloud container clusters list --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format="table(name,releaseChannel.channel,currentMasterVersion,currentNodeVersion)"

# Check if an upgrade is available
gcloud container get-server-config \
  --region us-west1 --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format="yaml(channels)"
```

### Security Posture

Each cluster has **Security Posture** enabled in `BASIC` mode with `VULNERABILITY_BASIC` scanning. This feature continuously evaluates your cluster against security best practices and scans workload container images for known CVEs.

**What Security Posture provides:**
- **Workload configuration auditing**: flags pods running as root, containers without resource limits, missing liveness/readiness probes, and other misconfigurations
- **Vulnerability scanning**: scans container images in running workloads against OS and language package vulnerability databases
- **Actionable findings**: surfaces issues in the GKE Security Posture dashboard with severity ratings and remediation guidance

This is distinct from Artifact Registry vulnerability scanning, which scans images at push time. Security Posture scans *running* workloads, catching drift between what was pushed and what is actually deployed.

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Kubernetes Engine → Security Posture** to see workload configuration findings and vulnerability scan results grouped by severity across all clusters.

**Inspect via CLI:**
```bash
# List active Security Posture findings for a cluster
gcloud container clusters describe gke-cluster-1 \
  --region us-west1 --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format="value(securityPostureConfig)"
```

### Workload Identity

For **Standard clusters**, **Workload Identity** is enabled. This is the recommended mechanism for granting Kubernetes workloads access to Google Cloud APIs without static service account keys.

**How it works:**
1. Each GKE cluster gets a Workload Identity Pool: `PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog`
2. A Kubernetes Service Account (KSA) is annotated to link it to a Google Service Account (GSA)
3. The GSA is granted an IAM binding that allows the KSA to impersonate it
4. Pods using that KSA call GCP APIs using short-lived tokens — no key files, no secrets

**Why this matters**: Traditional approaches mount a JSON key file as a Kubernetes Secret. If that secret leaks via a compromised pod, the key can be used from anywhere. With Workload Identity, credentials are short-lived tokens issued by GKE's metadata server and are only valid from within the cluster.

In this module, Bank of Anthos uses Workload Identity to send traces to Cloud Trace and metrics to Cloud Monitoring.

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Kubernetes Engine → Clusters → (cluster name) → Details** and confirm the Workload Identity field shows `PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog`.

**Inspect via CLI:**
```bash
# Confirm Workload Identity pool on the cluster
gcloud container clusters describe gke-cluster-1 \
  --region us-west1 --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format="value(workloadIdentityConfig.workloadPool)"

# View the Kubernetes Service Account annotation linking KSA to GSA
kubectl get serviceaccount bank-of-anthos \
  -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 -o yaml | grep iam.gke.io
```

### Managed Prometheus

**Managed Service for Prometheus** is enabled on each cluster — Google's fully managed, Prometheus-compatible monitoring solution built into GKE.

**What it provides:**
- Prometheus-compatible metrics collection without deploying or managing a Prometheus server
- Automatic scraping of Kubernetes system components (`kube-state-metrics`, `node-exporter`, `kubelet`)
- Long-term storage backed by Google's Monarch metrics infrastructure
- Query interface via Cloud Monitoring or PromQL
- Out-of-the-box dashboards for cluster health, node utilisation, and workload metrics

The module enables `SYSTEM_COMPONENTS` metric collection by default. Workload-level scraping of custom `/metrics` endpoints requires a `PodMonitoring` or `ClusterPodMonitoring` custom resource.

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Monitoring → Dashboards** and open the **GKE** dashboard group. Select **GKE Cluster Overview** to see node and pod metrics, or **Kubernetes Engine Prometheus Overview** for Prometheus metrics.

**Inspect via CLI:**
```bash
# Confirm Managed Prometheus is enabled on the cluster
gcloud container clusters describe gke-cluster-1 \
  --region us-west1 --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format="value(monitoringConfig.managedPrometheusConfig.enabled)"

# List any PodMonitoring resources already deployed
kubectl get podmonitoring -A --context $CTX1
```

### GCS FUSE CSI Driver

The **Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver** is enabled on all clusters, allowing pods to mount Google Cloud Storage buckets as a POSIX-compatible filesystem.

**Use cases in a microservices context:**
- Sharing large static assets (ML models, media files, config bundles) across pods without baking them into container images
- Mounting read-only reference data updated externally (e.g. a bucket populated by a CI pipeline)
- Offloading large write workloads (logs, exports) directly to GCS without a separate sidecar

To use the driver, annotate your service account and reference a GCS bucket in your pod's volume spec. The driver handles mounting, credential negotiation via Workload Identity, and FUSE kernel integration transparently.

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Kubernetes Engine → Clusters → (cluster name) → Details** and look for **GCS FUSE CSI driver** under the Storage section — it should show as **Enabled**.

**Inspect via CLI:**
```bash
# Confirm the GCS FUSE CSI driver is enabled
gcloud container clusters describe gke-cluster-1 \
  --region us-west1 --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format="value(addonsConfig.gcsFuseCsiDriverConfig.enabled)"

# Verify the CSI driver pods are running in the cluster
kubectl get pods -n kube-system --context $CTX1 \
  -l k8s-app=gcs-fuse-csi-driver
```

See **Exercise 9** for a complete hands-on walkthrough of mounting a GCS bucket into a pod.

### Gateway API

The **Gateway API** is enabled on `CHANNEL_STANDARD`. Gateway API is the successor to the Kubernetes Ingress resource, providing a more expressive, role-oriented model for configuring traffic routing.

| Capability | Ingress | Gateway API |
|---|---|---|
| Traffic splitting | Limited / annotation-based | Native (HTTPRoute weights) |
| Header-based routing | Annotation-based | Native |
| Role separation | Single resource | Separate Gateway + Route objects |
| Protocol support | HTTP/HTTPS | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, gRPC, TLS |

**Inspect via CLI:**
```bash
# Confirm Gateway API is enabled and list available GatewayClasses
kubectl get gatewayclass --context $CTX1

# List any deployed Gateway and HTTPRoute resources
kubectl get gateway,httproute -A --context $CTX1
```

### Cost Management

**GKE Cost Management** is enabled on all clusters. This feature attributes resource costs (CPU, memory, storage) to Kubernetes namespaces and labels, enabling per-team or per-workload cost visibility within a shared cluster. Cost data is available in the Google Cloud Billing console and exportable to BigQuery.

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Billing → Reports** and add a grouping by **Label → k8s-namespace** or **Label → k8s-cluster-name** to see cost attribution by workload. A dedicated GKE cost breakdown view is available under **Kubernetes Engine → Clusters → (cluster name) → Observability → Cost**.

## Networking

### VPC Design

All clusters share a single **custom VPC network** with GLOBAL routing mode. Using a global VPC means that subnets in different regions can communicate over Google's private backbone without requiring VPC peering or additional routing configuration. This simplifies multi-cluster networking — pods in us-west1 can reach services in us-east1 using internal RFC 1918 addresses.

The VPC uses `auto_create_subnetworks = false`, meaning no default subnets are created. Every subnet is explicitly defined and sized to match the requirements of each cluster.

**Why a custom VPC over the default VPC?**
The default VPC uses auto-mode subnets with pre-assigned, fixed CIDR ranges. Custom VPCs give you full control over IP address planning, which matters when:
- You need to avoid overlapping with on-premises or partner networks (VPN/Interconnect)
- You are planning for a specific number of nodes, pods, and services per cluster
- You want to enforce network segmentation between environments

### Subnet Design and IP Allocation

Each cluster receives a dedicated subnet with three IP ranges:

| Range type | CIDR (cluster 1 example) | Size | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary (nodes) | 10.0.0.0/20 | 4,096 IPs | Node VM addresses |
| Pod secondary range | 10.0.16.0/20 | 4,096 IPs | Pod IP addresses (VPC-native) |
| Service secondary range | 10.0.32.0/20 | 4,096 IPs | ClusterIP service addresses |

Subsequent clusters increment these ranges to avoid overlap (cluster 2 uses 10.0.64.0/20, 10.0.80.0/20, 10.0.96.0/20, and so on).

**VPC-native clusters**: GKE is configured to use VPC-native networking (alias IP ranges). This means pod IP addresses are drawn from the subnet's secondary range and are directly routable within the VPC — no IP masquerading is required for pod-to-pod communication across nodes. This is a prerequisite for Multi-Cluster Services and for using Container-native load balancing with Network Endpoint Groups (NEGs).

### Cloud Router and Cloud NAT

Each cluster subnet is paired with a **Cloud Router** and a **Cloud NAT gateway**. These provide outbound internet connectivity for nodes and pods without requiring public IP addresses on the nodes themselves.

**Cloud Router** establishes a BGP session used by Cloud NAT and, optionally, by Cloud Interconnect or Cloud VPN for hybrid connectivity.

**Cloud NAT** translates outbound traffic from private node and pod IP addresses to ephemeral external IPs managed by Google. Configuration details:

- **IP allocation**: `AUTO_ONLY` — Google automatically allocates and manages the external IPs. No static IPs need to be reserved for NAT.
- **Subnet targeting**: `LIST_OF_SUBNETWORKS` — NAT is applied only to the specific subnet for that cluster, avoiding conflicts when multiple clusters share the same region.
- **Log level**: `ERRORS_ONLY` — NAT translation errors are logged to Cloud Logging, helping diagnose connectivity failures without generating excessive log volume.

**Why private nodes with Cloud NAT?**
Running nodes without public IPs reduces the attack surface — nodes are not directly reachable from the internet. Outbound traffic (pulling container images, calling APIs) flows through NAT. Inbound traffic enters only through the load balancer.

### Firewall Rules

The module creates five explicit firewall rules. Understanding these is important for troubleshooting connectivity issues:

| Rule name | Direction | Source | Ports | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `allow-ssh` | Ingress | `0.0.0.0/0` | TCP 22 | SSH access to nodes (for debugging) |
| `allow-internal` | Ingress | All node, pod, and service CIDRs | TCP/UDP all, ICMP | Full communication between all cluster components |
| `allow-gke-masters` | Ingress | `172.16.0.0/28` | TCP, UDP, ICMP | GKE control plane to node communication |
| `allow-health-checks` | Ingress | Google health checker ranges | TCP | Load balancer health probes reaching pods |
| `allow-webhooks` | Ingress | Node CIDRs | TCP 443, 8443, 9443, 15017 | Istio/ASM admission webhook calls from API server to sidecar injector |

**The webhook rule** (`allow-webhooks`) is critical for ASM operation. When a pod is created in a mesh-enabled namespace, the Kubernetes API server calls the ASM sidecar injector webhook — an HTTPS call from the control plane to a pod running in the cluster. Without this rule, pod creation hangs or fails with a webhook timeout error.

**The health check rule** allows Google's load balancer probers to reach backend pods. These probers originate from four specific Google-owned CIDR ranges. Without this rule, all backends appear unhealthy and the load balancer returns 502 errors.

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **VPC Network → VPC Networks → vpc-network** to see all subnets, their primary and secondary IP ranges, and the regions they are deployed in.

**Inspect via CLI:**
```bash
# List all subnets and their IP ranges
gcloud compute networks subnets list \
  --network vpc-network --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format="table(name,region,ipCidrRange,secondaryIpRanges[].rangeName,secondaryIpRanges[].ipCidrRange)"

# List all firewall rules on the VPC
gcloud compute firewall-rules list \
  --filter="network:vpc-network" --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format="table(name,direction,sourceRanges[].list():label=SOURCES,allowed[].map().firewall_rule().list():label=ALLOW)"

# Describe a specific Cloud NAT gateway
gcloud compute routers nats describe nat-gateway-cluster1 \
  --router router-cluster1 \
  --region us-west1 --project PROJECT_ID

# Check Cloud NAT logs for translation errors
gcloud logging read \
  'resource.type="nat_gateway" severity>=WARNING' \
  --project PROJECT_ID --limit 20 --format="table(timestamp,textPayload)"
```

### Static External IP Addresses

One static external IP address is reserved per cluster. These are used for cluster-level ingress and for identity purposes when establishing cross-cluster communication. Static IPs persist across cluster recreations, allowing DNS records and firewall allowlists to remain stable even if the cluster is rebuilt.

**Inspect via CLI:**
```bash
# List all reserved static IPs for this deployment
gcloud compute addresses list --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format="table(name,region,address,status)"
```

## GKE Fleet Management

### What is a GKE Fleet?

A **GKE Fleet** (formerly Anthos fleet) is a logical grouping of Kubernetes clusters that can be managed, configured, and monitored together as a single unit. Fleets are the foundation for all multi-cluster features in GKE — including Multi-Cluster Ingress, Multi-Cluster Services, and Cloud Service Mesh.

Clusters in a fleet share:
- A common **configuration namespace** for fleet-wide policy distribution
- A unified **identity trust domain** enabling cross-cluster service authentication
- Access to **fleet-level features** that span all registered clusters simultaneously

### Fleet Registration

Each cluster is registered as a **Fleet Membership** immediately after creation. The membership:
- Links the cluster to the fleet using its GKE resource path
- Establishes an **OIDC issuer** (`container.googleapis.com`) so the fleet can verify tokens issued by the cluster's API server
- Assigns the cluster a membership ID matching its cluster name

After registration, the module waits for the membership state to reach `READY` before proceeding — checking up to 60 times over 10 minutes. This wait is necessary because fleet registration involves certificate exchange and identity bootstrapping that happens asynchronously.

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Kubernetes Engine → Fleets** to see all registered clusters, their membership status, and which fleet features are enabled. The **Feature** tab shows the per-cluster state of ASM, MCI, and MCS.

**Checking fleet membership and feature status:**
```bash
# List all cluster memberships and their states
gcloud container fleet memberships list --project PROJECT_ID

# Describe a specific membership
gcloud container fleet memberships describe gke-cluster-1 \
  --location global --project PROJECT_ID

# List all fleet features and their states
gcloud container fleet features list --project PROJECT_ID

# View detailed feature status including per-cluster states
gcloud container fleet features describe multiclusteringress \
  --project PROJECT_ID
gcloud container fleet features describe servicemesh \
  --project PROJECT_ID
gcloud container fleet features describe multiclusterservicediscovery \
  --project PROJECT_ID
```

### Fleet IAM

The GKE Hub service identity (`gkehub.googleapis.com`) is granted two roles at the project level:

| Role | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `roles/gkehub.serviceAgent` | Allows the Hub service to manage fleet memberships and features |
| `roles/container.viewer` | Allows the Hub service to read cluster state for health reporting |

These are service-agent roles granted to Google-managed service accounts, not to end-user identities.

**Inspect Fleet IAM bindings via CLI:**
```bash
# View all IAM bindings for the GKE Hub service agent
gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID \
  --flatten="bindings[].members" \
  --filter="bindings.members~gkehub" \
  --format="table(bindings.role,bindings.members)"

# Confirm the Hub service identity email
gcloud beta services identity create \
  --service=gkehub.googleapis.com \
  --project PROJECT_ID
```

### Fleet Features

Fleet **features** are capabilities that are enabled at the fleet level and automatically apply to all registered member clusters. This module enables the following fleet features:

| Feature | API | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Cloud Service Mesh | `mesh.googleapis.com` | All clusters |
| Multi-Cluster Ingress | `multiclusteringress.googleapis.com` | All clusters, config on cluster1 |
| Multi-Cluster Services | `multiclusterservicediscovery.googleapis.com` | All clusters |

Enabling a feature at the fleet level means you do not need to configure it cluster-by-cluster. New clusters added to the fleet can inherit these features automatically.

---

## Cloud Service Mesh (Anthos Service Mesh)

### What is Cloud Service Mesh?

**Cloud Service Mesh (CSM)**, formerly known as Anthos Service Mesh (ASM), is Google's managed distribution of Istio. It adds a network infrastructure layer — a **service mesh** — that sits between your application containers and the network, handling cross-cutting concerns such as mutual TLS encryption, traffic management, observability, and policy enforcement without requiring any changes to application code.

The mesh consists of two planes:

- **Data plane**: Envoy proxy sidecars injected into every pod. All inbound and outbound pod traffic passes through the sidecar. The sidecar enforces policies, collects telemetry, and performs load balancing.
- **Control plane**: Managed by Google (`istiod` running as a Google-managed component). The control plane pushes configuration to all sidecars and issues mTLS certificates via its built-in certificate authority.

### Automatic Management Mode

This module enables ASM with `MANAGEMENT_AUTOMATIC` mode at both the fleet level and per-cluster membership. In this mode:

- Google provisions and manages the Istio control plane entirely
- Control plane upgrades happen automatically, aligned with the cluster's release channel
- No `istiod` pods appear in your cluster — the control plane runs in Google's infrastructure
- You interact with the mesh only through Kubernetes custom resources (`VirtualService`, `DestinationRule`, `PeerAuthentication`, etc.)

This is distinct from **manual management mode**, where you install and upgrade `istiod` yourself using the `asmcli` tool.

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Kubernetes Engine → Service Mesh** to see the live service topology graph, per-service golden signals, and the health of the control plane across all clusters.

**Checking mesh status:**
```bash
# Overall mesh health across all clusters
gcloud container fleet mesh describe --project PROJECT_ID

# Verify ASM control plane components are running
kubectl get pods -n istio-system --context $CTX1
kubectl get pods -n asm-system --context $CTX1

# View the managed ASM revision in use
kubectl get controlplanerevision -n istio-system --context $CTX1
```

### Sidecar Injection

Sidecar injection is controlled at the namespace level using a label. The `bank-of-anthos` namespace carries the label:

```
istio.io/rev=asm-managed
```

This tells the ASM mutating admission webhook to inject an Envoy sidecar into every new pod created in this namespace. The revision label (`asm-managed`) pins injection to the Google-managed control plane revision rather than a specific version string, ensuring injected sidecars automatically track the managed revision.

**What the sidecar does:**
- Intercepts all inbound and outbound TCP traffic using `iptables` rules set up by an init container
- Terminates and originates mTLS connections, encrypting all pod-to-pod traffic within the mesh
- Reports request telemetry (latency, error rate, traffic volume) to Cloud Monitoring
- Enforces `AuthorizationPolicy` rules (which services can talk to which)
- Participates in distributed tracing by propagating trace context headers to Cloud Trace

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Kubernetes Engine → Service Mesh → (cluster) → Workloads** to see all injected workloads and their sidecar proxy version.

**Verify sidecar injection via CLI:**
```bash
# Confirm every pod in the namespace has 2 containers (app + istio-proxy)
kubectl get pods -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 \
  -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{range .spec.containers[*]}{.name}{" "}{end}{"\n"}{end}'

# Check the ASM sidecar proxy version injected into a pod
FRONTEND_POD=$(kubectl get pod -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 \
  -l app=frontend -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl get pod $FRONTEND_POD -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 \
  -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.sidecar\.istio\.io/status}' | python3 -m json.tool

# Confirm the namespace injection label is present
kubectl get namespace bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 \
  --show-labels
```

### Mutual TLS (mTLS)

With ASM enabled, all communication between pods in the mesh is encrypted with **mutual TLS** by default. Each sidecar is issued a short-lived X.509 certificate by the ASM certificate authority. The certificate encodes the workload's SPIFFE identity:

```
spiffe://PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog/ns/NAMESPACE/sa/SERVICE_ACCOUNT
```

This identity is verifiable by any other sidecar in the mesh, enabling fine-grained `AuthorizationPolicy` rules such as:

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend-only
  namespace: bank-of-anthos
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ledger-writer
  action: ALLOW
  rules:
  - from:
    - source:
        principals:
        - "cluster.local/ns/bank-of-anthos/sa/bank-of-anthos"
```

This policy permits only the `bank-of-anthos` service account (used by the frontend) to call the `ledger-writer` service — all other callers are denied, regardless of network-level access.

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Kubernetes Engine → Service Mesh → Security** to see the mTLS status across all services — which are in STRICT mode, PERMISSIVE, or DISABLED.

**Verify mTLS is active via CLI:**
```bash
# Check the default PeerAuthentication policy in the mesh namespace
kubectl get peerauthentication -n istio-system --context $CTX1
kubectl get peerauthentication -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1

# Inspect the mTLS certificate issued to the frontend sidecar
kubectl exec -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 $FRONTEND_POD \
  -c istio-proxy -- \
  openssl s_client -connect userservice.bank-of-anthos.svc.cluster.local:8080 \
  -showcerts 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -text | grep -E "Subject:|Issuer:|URI:"

# List all AuthorizationPolicies in the namespace
kubectl get authorizationpolicy -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1
```

### Traffic Management

ASM provides rich traffic management through Istio custom resources. These operate at Layer 7 (HTTP/gRPC) and allow:

- **VirtualService**: define routing rules — route 10% of traffic to a canary version, retry failed requests up to 3 times, inject artificial delays for chaos testing
- **DestinationRule**: configure load balancing algorithm (round-robin, least-connections, consistent hashing), circuit breaker thresholds, and connection pool settings per destination service
- **ServiceEntry**: register external services (outside the mesh) so sidecars can apply policies and collect telemetry for egress traffic

**Inspect existing Istio traffic resources via CLI:**
```bash
# List all Istio traffic management resources in the namespace
kubectl get virtualservice,destinationrule,serviceentry,gateway \
  -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1

# Describe a specific VirtualService to see routing rules
kubectl describe virtualservice RESOURCE_NAME \
  -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1

# View Envoy's current routing table for a sidecar (shows effect of all VirtualServices)
kubectl exec -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 $FRONTEND_POD \
  -c istio-proxy -- pilot-agent request GET routes | python3 -m json.tool | head -80
```

**Example: Canary deployment with traffic splitting**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: frontend
  namespace: bank-of-anthos
spec:
  hosts:
  - frontend
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: frontend
        subset: stable
      weight: 90
    - destination:
        host: frontend
        subset: canary

### Observability with ASM

ASM automatically generates the **golden signals** (latency, traffic, errors, saturation) for every service-to-service call in the mesh, with no instrumentation changes required in the application.

**Service metrics** are available in Cloud Monitoring under the `istio.io` metric namespace:
- `istio.io/service/server/request_count` — inbound request volume
- `istio.io/service/server/response_latencies` — inbound request latency distribution
- `istio.io/service/client/request_count` — outbound request volume per destination

**Service topology** is visualised in the **Cloud Service Mesh dashboard** in the Google Cloud Console. This shows a live graph of all services, their communication paths, error rates, and latency — built automatically from sidecar telemetry without any manual configuration.

**Distributed traces** are sent to Cloud Trace. Each request that enters the mesh generates a trace spanning all microservice hops, allowing engineers to pinpoint which service introduced a latency spike or error.

### Istio ConfigMap for Stackdriver

This module applies a ConfigMap to the `istio-system` namespace that explicitly enables **Stackdriver** (Cloud Monitoring/Trace) as the telemetry backend for ASM:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: istio-asm-managed
  namespace: istio-system
data:
  mesh: |
    defaultConfig:
      tracing:
        stackdriver: {}
```

This ensures that trace spans from all sidecar proxies are exported to Cloud Trace using the Stackdriver exporter, making distributed traces visible in the Cloud Console without any per-pod instrumentation.

### Multi-Cluster Mesh

When ASM is enabled across multiple clusters in the same fleet, the mesh spans cluster boundaries. Services in `cluster1` can call services in `cluster2` using their Kubernetes DNS names, with the sidecar handling the cross-cluster routing, mTLS, and telemetry transparently.

This is possible because all clusters share the same **trust domain** (`PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog`). Certificates issued by the ASM CA in either cluster are trusted by sidecars in all clusters, enabling mutual authentication across cluster boundaries.

**Verify cross-cluster mesh connectivity via CLI:**
```bash
# Confirm both clusters share the same trust domain
gcloud container fleet mesh describe --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format="json" | python3 -m json.tool | grep -A2 "trustDomain"

# From cluster1, resolve a service endpoint that exists only on cluster2
# (MCS exports services across clusters using the .cluster.local DNS)
kubectl exec -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 $FRONTEND_POD \
  -c istio-proxy -- \
  curl -s http://frontend.bank-of-anthos.svc.cluster.local:8080/ready

# View cross-cluster endpoints registered by the MCS controller
kubectl get serviceimport -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1
kubectl get serviceexport -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1
```

## Multi-Cluster Ingress and Global Load Balancing

### The Problem Multi-Cluster Ingress Solves

In a single-cluster deployment, a standard Kubernetes `Ingress` resource provisions a regional Google Cloud Load Balancer with backends in one region. Users in other regions are served from that single region, introducing latency. If that region experiences an outage, the application becomes unavailable.

**Multi-Cluster Ingress (MCI)** solves this by provisioning a single **Global External Application Load Balancer** whose backends span multiple GKE clusters across regions. Google's network routes each user's request to the nearest healthy cluster — the same anycast routing used by Google's own global services.

### Architecture

```
User (Europe)          User (US East)         User (Asia)
      │                      │                      │
      └──────────────────────┼──────────────────────┘
                             │
                  Global Anycast IP (single IP)
                             │
                  Google Cloud Load Balancer
                  (globally distributed POPs)
                             │
              ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
              ▼                             ▼
   NEG (us-west1 cluster1)       NEG (us-east1 cluster2)
   frontend pods                 frontend pods
```

A single global IP address is reserved and used across all regions. Google's Premium Tier network routes traffic to the closest point of presence, then carries it over Google's backbone to the nearest healthy cluster.

### MultiClusterIngress Resource

The `MultiClusterIngress` custom resource is applied to the **config cluster** (`cluster1`). The GKE Hub Multi-Cluster Ingress controller watches this resource and provisions the underlying Google Cloud load balancer infrastructure.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.gke.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterIngress
metadata:
  name: bank-of-anthos-mci
  namespace: bank-of-anthos
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      backend:
        serviceName: bank-of-anthos-mcs
        servicePort: 80
```

**Key points:**
- Applied only to the config cluster — the MCI controller propagates load balancer configuration across all fleet clusters automatically
- References a `MultiClusterService` (not a regular Kubernetes Service) as its backend
- The MCI controller creates and manages Network Endpoint Groups (NEGs) in every cluster where matching pods are running

### MultiClusterService Resource

The `MultiClusterService` (MCS) resource defines which pods across which clusters should be included as backends for the global load balancer.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.gke.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterService
metadata:
  name: bank-of-anthos-mcs
  namespace: bank-of-anthos
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      selector:
        app: frontend
      ports:
      - name: http
        protocol: TCP
        port: 80
        targetPort: 8080
  clusters:
  - link: "us-west1/gke-cluster-1"
  - link: "us-east1/gke-cluster-2"
```

The `clusters` list explicitly enumerates which cluster deployments contribute backends. The MCI controller creates a corresponding `NodePort` service (for load balancer health checks) and a NEG in each listed cluster.

**MCS vs standard Kubernetes Service**: A standard `Service` of type `LoadBalancer` provisions a regional load balancer — one per cluster, one per region, with separate IPs. An MCS with MCI provisions one global load balancer with backends in all listed clusters. You manage one resource, not N.

### NodePort Service and BackendConfig

Each cluster also runs a `NodePort` service for the frontend, which the global load balancer uses to reach pods. This service is annotated to reference a `BackendConfig`:

```yaml
apiVersion: cloud.google.com/v1
kind: BackendConfig
metadata:
  name: bank-of-anthos
  namespace: bank-of-anthos
spec:
  healthCheck:
    checkIntervalSec: 2
    timeoutSec: 1
    healthyThreshold: 1
    unhealthyThreshold: 10
    type: HTTP
    requestPath: /
  iap:
    enabled: false
```

**BackendConfig** customises the behaviour of the Google Cloud load balancer backend service. Key settings here:

- **Health check interval of 2 seconds** with an unhealthy threshold of 10 — the load balancer marks a backend unhealthy only after 10 consecutive failures (20 seconds), avoiding flapping during brief pod restarts
- **Healthy threshold of 1** — a single successful probe immediately marks a backend healthy, minimising the time new pods take to receive traffic after startup
- **IAP disabled** — Identity-Aware Proxy is not enabled, but the `BackendConfig` structure is in place so IAP can be switched on without changing the service configuration

### Managed Certificates

TLS termination is handled by a **Google-managed TLS certificate** provisioned automatically by GCP. No manual certificate procurement, CSR generation, or renewal is required.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.gke.io/v1
kind: ManagedCertificate
metadata:
  name: bank-of-anthos
  namespace: bank-of-anthos
spec:
  domains:
  - boa.GLOBAL_IP.sslip.io
```

The domain uses **sslip.io** — a public DNS service that resolves any domain of the form `ADDRESS.sslip.io` to `ADDRESS`. This allows the module to provision a valid publicly-resolvable domain and obtain a real TLS certificate without requiring a custom domain or DNS zone configuration.

**Certificate lifecycle:**
1. The `ManagedCertificate` resource is created referencing the sslip.io domain
2. GCP provisions the certificate via Let's Encrypt (or Google's CA)
3. The certificate is attached to the load balancer frontend automatically
4. GCP handles renewal before expiry — typically 30 days before the certificate expires

**Certificate provisioning takes 10–60 minutes** after the load balancer is created, as GCP must perform DNS validation. During this window, HTTPS requests may fail or show a certificate warning.

### FrontendConfig and HTTPS Redirect

A `FrontendConfig` resource enforces an HTTPS redirect, ensuring all HTTP traffic is automatically upgraded:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.gke.io/v1beta1
kind: FrontendConfig
metadata:
  name: bank-of-anthos
  namespace: bank-of-anthos
spec:
  redirectToHttps:
    enabled: true
    responseCodeName: MOVED_PERMANENTLY_DEFAULT
```

This configures the load balancer frontend to return HTTP 301 for any request arriving on port 80, redirecting the client to the HTTPS equivalent URL. This is enforced at the load balancer level — the redirect happens before traffic reaches any pod.

### Config Cluster Role

The Multi-Cluster Ingress feature requires one cluster to be designated as the **config cluster**. In this module, `cluster1` (us-west1) is the config cluster. The MCI controller runs in the GKE Hub control plane and watches the config cluster for `MultiClusterIngress` and `MultiClusterService` resources.

**Implications of the config cluster pattern:**
- All MCI/MCS resources must be applied to the config cluster, not to other clusters
- If the config cluster is unavailable, the load balancer continues serving traffic using its last known configuration — existing backends remain healthy
- The config cluster can be changed after deployment by updating the fleet feature configuration

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Network Services → Load Balancing** to see the global load balancer created by MCI. Click through to see the frontend (HTTPS/HTTP), the backend service, and the health status of each NEG (one per cluster). Navigate to **Network Services → Cloud Domains → Managed Certificates** or check certificate status under **Kubernetes Engine → (cluster) → Services & Ingress**.

**Inspect via CLI:**
```bash
# List all global load balancers (MCI creates one named after the MCI resource)
gcloud compute url-maps list --global --project PROJECT_ID

# Describe the backend service to see NEGs and health
BACKEND=$(gcloud compute backend-services list --global \
  --project PROJECT_ID --filter="name~bank-of-anthos" \
  --format="value(name)" | head -1)

gcloud compute backend-services describe $BACKEND \
  --global --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format="table(name,backends[].group,backends[].balancingMode)"

# Check backend health per NEG
gcloud compute backend-services get-health $BACKEND \
  --global --project PROJECT_ID

# List all NEGs created by MCI
gcloud compute network-endpoint-groups list \
  --project PROJECT_ID \
  --filter="name~bank-of-anthos" \
  --format="table(name,zone,networkEndpointType,size)"

# Check managed certificate provisioning state
kubectl get managedcertificate -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 \
  -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.status.certificateStatus}{"\n"}{end}'
```

### Traffic Flow End-to-End

1. A user's DNS query for `boa.GLOBAL_IP.sslip.io` resolves to the single global anycast IP
2. The user's TCP connection is terminated at the nearest Google point of presence
3. The load balancer selects the nearest healthy cluster backend using latency-based routing
4. The request is forwarded to a `NodePort` on a node in the selected cluster
5. The node routes the request to a frontend pod via the NEG
6. The frontend pod's Envoy sidecar intercepts the inbound request, applies policies, and records telemetry
7. The frontend calls downstream services (user-service, ledger-writer, etc.) over mTLS within the mesh

## Bank of Anthos Application

### Overview

**Bank of Anthos** (v0.6.7) is an open-source, HTTP-based banking simulation developed by Google Cloud Platform. It is the reference application deployed by this module and is the vehicle through which engineers interact with all the GKE features described in earlier sections. The application simulates a retail bank — users can create accounts, deposit funds, transfer money between accounts, and view transaction history.

The application is intentionally multi-language and multi-framework, reflecting the polyglot reality of real microservices platforms. This makes it a useful reference for understanding how a service mesh handles heterogeneous workloads consistently.

Source code and additional documentation: [https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bank-of-anthos](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bank-of-anthos)

### Microservices Architecture

The application consists of nine services, each running as an independent Kubernetes `Deployment`:

| Service | Language | Type | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **frontend** | Python (Flask) | Stateless | Web UI — serves HTML, handles login/signup, proxies API calls to backend services |
| **userservice** | Python (Flask) | Stateless | Account management — creates users, validates credentials, issues JWT tokens |
| **contacts** | Python (Flask) | Stateless | Contact list management — stores payee account numbers for a user |
| **ledgerwriter** | Java (Spring Boot) | Stateless | Transaction ingestion — validates and writes new transactions to the ledger database |
| **balancereader** | Java (Spring Boot) | Stateless | Balance cache — reads account balances from the ledger database with caching |
| **transactionhistory** | Java (Spring Boot) | Stateless | History cache — reads past transactions for a user with caching |
| **loadgenerator** | Python (Locust) | Stateless | Synthetic traffic — simulates realistic user activity against the frontend |
| **accounts-db** | PostgreSQL | Stateful | Stores user account records and contact data |
| **ledger-db** | PostgreSQL | Stateful | Stores the complete transaction ledger |

### Service Communication Map

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
          ┌────────▶│  userservice│
          │         └─────────────┘
          │         ┌─────────────┐
          ├────────▶│   contacts  │
          │         └─────────────┘
┌──────────┐        ┌─────────────┐
│ frontend │───────▶│ledgerwriter │───▶ ledger-db
└──────────┘        └─────────────┘
          │         ┌─────────────┐
          ├────────▶│balancereader│───▶ ledger-db
          │         └─────────────┘
          │         ┌──────────────────┐
          └────────▶│transactionhistory│───▶ ledger-db
                    └──────────────────┘

userservice ───▶ accounts-db
contacts    ───▶ accounts-db
```

All service-to-service calls are HTTP on port 8080. Within the mesh, these calls are transparently upgraded to mTLS by the Envoy sidecars. The frontend never calls a database directly — database access is encapsulated within the relevant backend service.

### Authentication: JWT Token Flow

Bank of Anthos implements stateless authentication using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**. Understanding this flow illustrates several important Kubernetes security patterns.

**JWT key pair**: A RSA key pair is generated at deployment time and stored as a Kubernetes `Secret` named `jwt-key` in the `bank-of-anthos` namespace. The private key is mounted into `userservice` (which signs tokens). The public key is mounted into all other services (which verify tokens).

**Login flow:**
1. User submits credentials to the frontend via an HTML form
2. Frontend forwards credentials to `userservice` over HTTP
3. `userservice` validates credentials against `accounts-db`
4. On success, `userservice` signs a JWT with the private key and returns it
5. Frontend stores the token in an HTTP-only cookie
6. All subsequent requests carry the JWT cookie

**Token verification:**
- Each service that handles authenticated requests mounts the JWT public key at `/tmp/.ssh/publickey`
- Incoming requests are verified locally — no call to `userservice` is needed per request
- Token expiry is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour) in `userservice`

**Why this matters for platform engineers**: The JWT secret is a textbook example of how to use Kubernetes Secrets for credential distribution across pods. The private key is only accessible to the one service that needs it; all other services receive only the public key. This principle of least privilege is enforced at the pod volume mount level.

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Kubernetes Engine → (cluster) → Config and Storage → Secrets** and find `jwt-key` in the `bank-of-anthos` namespace. The console shows which pods are consuming the secret as a volume mount.

**Inspect via CLI:**
```bash
# Confirm the JWT secret exists and see its keys (values are base64-encoded)
kubectl get secret jwt-key -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 \
  -o jsonpath='{.data}' | python3 -m json.tool | grep -o '"[^"]*":' 

# Confirm the public key is mounted into the frontend pod
FRONTEND_POD=$(kubectl get pod -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 \
  -l app=frontend -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 $FRONTEND_POD \
  -c frontend -- ls -la /tmp/.ssh/

# Inspect all ConfigMaps used for service discovery
kubectl get configmap -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1
kubectl describe configmap service-api-config \
  -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1
```

### Kubernetes Resource Patterns

The Bank of Anthos manifests demonstrate production-grade Kubernetes resource configuration. The following patterns are worth studying in detail.

#### Resource Requests and Limits

Every container defines explicit CPU and memory requests and limits. This is required for the GKE scheduler to make informed placement decisions and for the Kubernetes resource quota system to function correctly.

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Kubernetes Engine → Workloads** to see all Deployments and StatefulSets. Click any workload to see its pods, resource requests, limits, and current utilisation. The **Observability** tab shows CPU and memory graphs over time.

**Inspect via CLI:**
```bash
# View resource requests and limits for all containers in the namespace
kubectl get pods -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 \
  -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}{range .spec.containers[*]}  {.name}: cpu={.resources.requests.cpu}/{.resources.limits.cpu} mem={.resources.requests.memory}/{.resources.limits.memory}{"\n"}{end}{end}'

# Check actual resource consumption vs requests (requires metrics-server)
kubectl top pods -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1

# View QoS class assigned to each pod
kubectl get pods -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 \
  -o custom-columns="NAME:.metadata.name,QOS:.status.qosClass"
```

Example (frontend):
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 64Mi
  limits:
    cpu: 250m
    memory: 128Mi
```

Example (userservice — higher because it handles JWT cryptography):
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 260m
    memory: 128Mi
  limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 256Mi
```

**Requests vs limits:**
- **Requests** are used by the scheduler to select a node with sufficient available capacity. A pod is guaranteed at least its requested resources.
- **Limits** cap the maximum resources a container can consume. Exceeding the memory limit triggers an OOMKill. Exceeding the CPU limit causes throttling (not termination).
- Setting limits equal to requests creates a **Guaranteed** QoS class — the pod is the last to be evicted under memory pressure. Setting limits higher than requests creates **Burstable** QoS.

#### Security Contexts

Every container in Bank of Anthos runs with a strict security context:

```yaml
securityContext:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
    drop:
    - all
  privileged: false
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  runAsGroup: 1000
```

**What each setting does:**

| Setting | Effect |
|---|---|
| `runAsNonRoot: true` | Pod fails to start if the container image runs as UID 0 |
| `runAsUser: 1000` | Overrides the image's default user to UID 1000 |
| `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` | Container cannot write to its own filesystem — all writes must go to explicitly mounted volumes |
| `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` | Prevents `setuid` binaries from elevating privileges within the container |
| `capabilities: drop: [all]` | Removes all Linux capabilities (e.g. `NET_RAW`, `SYS_CHROOT`) — the container runs with no kernel-level privileges |

These settings align with the **Pod Security Standards** `restricted` profile and are enforced by GKE Security Posture's workload auditing.

Because `readOnlyRootFilesystem` is set, writable directories needed at runtime are provided as `emptyDir` volumes — typically `/tmp`:

```yaml
volumeMounts:
- name: tmp
  mountPath: /tmp
volumes:
- name: tmp
  emptyDir: {}
```

#### Health Probes

Every deployment configures both liveness and readiness probes against the `/ready` endpoint:

```yaml
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 60
  periodSeconds: 15
```

**Readiness vs liveness:**
- **Readiness probe**: determines whether the pod should receive traffic. A failing readiness probe removes the pod from Service endpoints — it stays running but gets no requests. Used to hold traffic until the application has finished initialising (e.g. loaded caches, established database connections).
- **Liveness probe**: determines whether the pod is alive. A failing liveness probe causes kubelet to restart the container. The 60-second initial delay gives the JVM-based Java services time to complete startup before liveness checking begins.

**Inspect live probe status via CLI:**
```bash
# View probe configuration and last result for all pods
kubectl get pods -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 \
  -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}{range .spec.containers[*]}  readiness: {.readinessProbe.httpGet.path}:{.readinessProbe.httpGet.port} delay={.readinessProbe.initialDelaySeconds}s{"\n"}{end}{end}'

# Check restart counts — high restarts indicate repeated liveness probe failures
kubectl get pods -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 \
  -o custom-columns="NAME:.metadata.name,RESTARTS:.status.containerStatuses[0].restartCount,READY:.status.containerStatuses[0].ready"

# View events for a pod to see probe failures
kubectl describe pod $FRONTEND_POD -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 | grep -A5 "Events:"
```

#### Stateful Services: PostgreSQL

The two databases (`accounts-db`, `ledger-db`) run as Kubernetes `StatefulSets`. StatefulSets provide:
- **Stable pod identity**: pods are named `ledger-db-0`, `ledger-db-1` etc. rather than random hashes
- **Ordered startup and shutdown**: pods start in order (0, then 1) and terminate in reverse order
- **Stable DNS**: each pod gets a stable DNS entry (`ledger-db-0.ledger-db.bank-of-anthos.svc.cluster.local`)

For this module, each database runs as a single replica (`replicas: 1`) with storage on an `emptyDir` volume. This is appropriate for a learning environment — data does not persist across pod restarts, keeping the application stateless from a cluster lifecycle perspective.

In a production deployment, the databases would use `PersistentVolumeClaims` backed by GCP Persistent Disks or Cloud SQL.

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Kubernetes Engine → Workloads** and filter by **Type: StatefulSet** to see `accounts-db` and `ledger-db`. Click either StatefulSet to inspect its pods, volumes, and events.

**Inspect StatefulSets and stable DNS via CLI:**
```bash
# List all StatefulSets in the namespace
kubectl get statefulsets -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1

# Describe a StatefulSet to see pod identity and volume configuration
kubectl describe statefulset ledger-db -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1

# Verify stable DNS resolution for the database pod
kubectl run dns-test --image=busybox --restart=Never \
  --context $CTX1 -n bank-of-anthos -- \
  nslookup ledger-db-0.ledger-db.bank-of-anthos.svc.cluster.local
kubectl logs dns-test -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1
kubectl delete pod dns-test -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1
```

#### ConfigMaps for Service Discovery

Service endpoint addresses are distributed to pods via Kubernetes `ConfigMap`s rather than hard-coded environment variables. The `service-api-config` ConfigMap maps each service name to its DNS address:

```yaml
LEDGER_ADDR: "ledgerwriter:8080"
BALANCES_ADDR: "balancereader:8080"
HISTORY_ADDR: "transactionhistory:8080"
CONTACTS_ADDR: "contacts:8080"
USERSERVICE_ADDR: "userservice:8080"
```

These resolve via Kubernetes DNS (`service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local`). The frontend reads these at startup and uses them for all backend API calls — no hardcoded IPs or external DNS lookups.

### Load Generator

The `loadgenerator` service runs **Locust**, an open-source load testing framework, continuously generating realistic synthetic traffic against the frontend. It simulates:
- New user signups
- Login and session management
- Account balance checks
- Peer-to-peer transfers between accounts

This is important for observability exploration — the load generator ensures the ASM service topology dashboard, Cloud Monitoring dashboards, and Cloud Trace all show live data immediately after deployment, without requiring manual interaction with the application.

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Kubernetes Engine → Workloads → loadgenerator** and select the **Logs** tab to see Locust output showing active users, request rates, and failure counts in real time.

**Inspect via CLI:**
```bash
# View load generator logs to see current traffic rates
kubectl logs -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 \
  -l app=loadgenerator --tail=20

# Check the load generator is reaching the frontend successfully
kubectl exec -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 \
  $(kubectl get pod -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 \
    -l app=loadgenerator -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
  -- env | grep FRONTEND_ADDR
```

### Additional Exploration: APIs Enabled but Not Exercised by Default

Three APIs are enabled by this module that enable powerful capabilities worth exploring independently.

#### Network Intelligence Center

`networkmanagement.googleapis.com` enables the **Network Intelligence Center** — Google Cloud's suite of network observability and troubleshooting tools.

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Network Intelligence Center → Connectivity Tests** to run point-to-point reachability tests between any source and destination within the VPC (pod IP → service IP, node → internet, etc.).

```bash
# Run a connectivity test from a node in cluster1 to the ledger-db service IP
LEDGER_IP=$(kubectl get service ledger-db -n bank-of-anthos \
  --context $CTX1 -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')

gcloud network-management connectivity-tests create ledger-reachability \
  --source-ip-address=10.0.0.2 \
  --source-network=vpc-network \
  --destination-ip-address=$LEDGER_IP \
  --destination-port=5432 \
  --protocol=TCP \
  --project PROJECT_ID

gcloud network-management connectivity-tests describe ledger-reachability \
  --project PROJECT_ID
```

Navigate to **Network Intelligence Center → Network Topology** for a visual map of all VPC resources, traffic flows, and their interconnections across regions.

#### Web Security Scanner

`websecurityscanner.googleapis.com` enables **Web Security Scanner** — an automated DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tool that crawls the frontend URL and probes for common web vulnerabilities (XSS, mixed content, outdated libraries, etc.).

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Security → Web Security Scanner → New Scan** and enter the `https://boa.GLOBAL_IP.sslip.io` URL. Run a scan and review findings in the results panel.

```bash
# Create a scan config targeting the frontend
gcloud alpha web-security-scanner scan-configs create \
  --display-name="bank-of-anthos-scan" \
  --starting-urls="https://boa.GLOBAL_IP.sslip.io" \
  --project PROJECT_ID

# List scan configs
gcloud alpha web-security-scanner scan-configs list --project PROJECT_ID
```

This is a useful demonstration of how a platform team can automate security testing of applications running on GKE without any changes to the application itself.

#### Policy Controller (OPA Gatekeeper)

`anthospolicycontroller.googleapis.com` enables **Policy Controller** — a Kubernetes admission controller based on Open Policy Agent (OPA) Gatekeeper. It enforces custom policies at the point of resource creation, preventing non-compliant Kubernetes objects from being admitted to the cluster.

Policy Controller can enforce rules such as:
- All containers must have resource limits set
- No container may run as root (UID 0)
- All Deployments must have at least 2 replicas
- Images must come from approved registries only

**Enable Policy Controller on the fleet:**
```bash
gcloud container fleet policycontroller enable \
  --memberships=gke-cluster-1,gke-cluster-2 \
  --project PROJECT_ID
```

**Apply a built-in constraint to require resource limits:**
```bash
kubectl apply --context $CTX1 -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: K8sRequiredResources
metadata:
  name: require-resource-limits
spec:
  match:
    kinds:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      kinds: ["Pod"]
    namespaces: ["bank-of-anthos"]
  parameters:
    limits:
    - cpu
    - memory
EOF
```

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Kubernetes Engine → Policy Controller** to see constraint violations across all fleet clusters in a unified view. This dashboard shows which constraints are active, which resources violate them, and the violation history over time.

---

## Deployment Lifecycle

### Apply Phase

When the module is deployed, resources are created in the following sequence. Each phase depends on the previous completing successfully.

**Phase 1 — Infrastructure (≈ 5–15 minutes)**
- Custom VPC and subnets are created
- Cloud Routers and NAT gateways are provisioned
- Static external IP addresses are reserved
- Firewall rules are applied
- GKE clusters are created (Autopilot or Standard)

GKE cluster creation is the most time-consuming step. Autopilot clusters typically provision in 5–8 minutes. Standard clusters provision in 3–5 minutes but require an additional 2–4 minutes for node pool nodes to join and become Ready.

**Monitor Phase 1 progress:**
```bash
# Watch cluster provisioning status
watch -n 10 gcloud container clusters list --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format="table(name,location,status,currentMasterVersion)"

# Once clusters are RUNNING, confirm all nodes are Ready
kubectl get nodes --context $CTX1
kubectl get nodes --context $CTX2
```

**Phase 2 — Fleet Registration (≈ 5–10 minutes)**
- GKE Hub service identity is created
- Each cluster is registered as a Fleet membership
- The module polls for membership state `READY` — checking every 10 seconds for up to 10 minutes per cluster
- Memberships must reach READY before ASM can be enabled

**Monitor Phase 2 progress:**
```bash
# Poll fleet membership state
watch -n 15 "gcloud container fleet memberships list \
  --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format='table(name,state.code,updateTime)'"
```

**Phase 3 — Service Mesh (≈ 10–20 minutes)**
- Fleet-level ASM feature is enabled
- Per-cluster ASM membership management is set to `MANAGEMENT_AUTOMATIC`
- The module polls for mesh configuration state — checking every 15 seconds for up to 15 minutes
- If ASM does not reach configured state within the timeout, the module continues with a warning — ASM provisioning often completes shortly after

**Monitor Phase 3 progress:**
```bash
# Watch ASM provisioning state per cluster
watch -n 20 "gcloud container fleet mesh describe \
  --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format='table(membershipStates)'"
```

**Phase 4 — Application (≈ 5–10 minutes)**
- Bank of Anthos v0.6.7 is downloaded from GitHub
- The `bank-of-anthos` namespace is created on each cluster with the ASM injection label
- The JWT key pair secret is applied to each cluster
- All Kubernetes manifests are applied using server-side apply
- The module waits up to 10 minutes for all Deployments to reach `Available` condition
- Multi-Cluster Ingress feature is enabled in the fleet
- MCI, MCS, NodePort, BackendConfig, ManagedCertificate, FrontendConfig, and Istio ConfigMap are applied to the config cluster

**Monitor Phase 4 progress:**
```bash
# Watch pod rollout across both clusters
watch -n 10 "kubectl get pods -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 && \
  echo '---' && \
  kubectl get pods -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX2"

# Watch deployment readiness
kubectl rollout status deployment -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1
kubectl rollout status deployment -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX2

# Watch managed certificate provisioning
watch -n 30 "kubectl get managedcertificate \
  -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1"
```

**Explore deployment progress in the Console**: Navigate to **Kubernetes Engine → Workloads** to see all Deployments and their readiness status in real time. Navigate to **Kubernetes Engine → Services & Ingress** to monitor the MCI and ManagedCertificate status.

**Total deployment time**: approximately 25–55 minutes end-to-end, depending on region and GCP service latency.

### Idempotency

All Kubernetes resources are applied using `--server-side --force-conflicts`. This means re-running the deployment:
- Creates resources that do not exist
- Updates resources whose configuration has changed
- Leaves unchanged resources unmodified
- Does not delete resources that are no longer referenced (use `kubectl delete` explicitly for removals)

This makes re-applies safe and predictable — running the deployment twice produces the same result as running it once.

### Destroy Phase

Teardown follows the reverse dependency order and includes several explicit cleanup steps that Terraform alone cannot handle:

**Step 1 — MCI resource cleanup**
MultiClusterIngress and MultiClusterService resources are deleted first. These resources instruct Google Cloud to deprovision the global load balancer backends and NEGs. The module waits up to 3 minutes for the `MultiClusterIngress` to be fully deleted before proceeding. Skipping this step leaves orphaned load balancer components that block VPC deletion.

**Step 2 — ASM membership disable**
ASM is disabled per-cluster membership (`--management manual`) before fleet unregistration. This allows the ASM control plane to cleanly withdraw from the cluster.

**Step 3 — MCI feature disable**
The Multi-Cluster Ingress fleet feature is disabled using `gcloud alpha container hub ingress disable --force`. This removes the MCI controller and cleans up fleet-level load balancer state.

**Step 4 — Fleet unregistration**
Each cluster membership is deleted from the fleet. This severs the cluster's connection to GKE Hub and removes it from all fleet features.

**Step 5 — Fleet-level ASM disable**
After all memberships are unregistered, the fleet-level ASM feature is disabled.

**Step 6 — Infrastructure teardown**
Kubernetes namespaces are deleted (with a 15-minute timeout to allow finalizers to complete), then GKE clusters, node pools, subnets, routers, NAT gateways, and finally the VPC are deleted.

**Step 7 — Network cleanup**
Before the VPC is deleted, a cleanup script removes GKE-managed firewall rules (matching `gke-*-mcsd`) and Network Endpoint Groups (matching `gsmrsvd*`) that were created by GKE but are not managed by this module's Terraform state. Without this step, VPC deletion fails with a "resource in use" error.

**Total destroy time**: approximately 15–30 minutes.

---

## Observability

This module enables a comprehensive, multi-layer observability stack. No additional tooling needs to be installed — everything is available immediately after deployment through the Google Cloud Console.

### Cloud Monitoring

Cloud Monitoring is the primary metrics platform for this deployment. GKE automatically exports metrics from multiple sources:

**System component metrics** (enabled by default on all clusters):
- `kubernetes.io/node/*` — node CPU, memory, disk, and network utilisation
- `kubernetes.io/pod/*` — pod CPU and memory consumption
- `kubernetes.io/container/*` — container restarts, resource requests vs actual usage
- `kubernetes.io/node_daemon/*` — kubelet and system daemon health

**Managed Prometheus metrics** (collected via the built-in Prometheus scraper):
- All standard Prometheus exposition format metrics from pods annotated for scraping
- Kubernetes control plane metrics (API server request rate, etcd latency, scheduler throughput)

**Viewing metrics in the Cloud Console:**

Navigate to **Monitoring → Metrics Explorer** and use the following resource types:
- `k8s_cluster` — cluster-level aggregates
- `k8s_node` — per-node metrics
- `k8s_pod` — per-pod metrics
- `k8s_container` — per-container metrics

**Pre-built GKE dashboards** are available under **Monitoring → Dashboards → GKE**:
- **GKE Cluster Overview**: node count, pod count, CPU/memory utilisation trends
- **GKE Workloads**: per-Deployment resource usage, restart counts, availability
- **Kubernetes Engine Prometheus Overview**: Prometheus metrics from all scraped targets

### Cloud Service Mesh Dashboard

The **Cloud Service Mesh dashboard** is the most valuable observability surface for understanding microservice behaviour. It is available under **Kubernetes Engine → Service Mesh** in the Google Cloud Console.

**What the dashboard shows:**
- **Service topology graph**: a live, auto-generated map of all services and their communication edges, built from sidecar telemetry. Each edge shows request rate, error rate, and latency.
- **Service-level SLOs**: for each service, the dashboard displays the four golden signals — latency, traffic (requests/sec), error rate, and saturation (resource utilisation)
- **Per-service details**: drill into any service to see inbound and outbound request breakdowns, latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99), and error code distributions

Because the load generator continuously sends traffic, all services will show populated metrics immediately after deployment. This makes the topology graph an excellent starting point for understanding how the microservices interact.

**ASM metrics in Cloud Monitoring** are accessible under the `istio.io` metric namespace:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| `istio.io/service/server/request_count` | Total inbound requests per service |
| `istio.io/service/server/response_latencies` | Inbound request latency distribution |
| `istio.io/service/client/request_count` | Outbound requests per source/destination pair |
| `istio.io/service/client/roundtrip_latencies` | End-to-end client-side latency |

### Cloud Logging

All cluster logs are exported to Cloud Logging automatically. GKE collects logs from two sources:

**System component logs** (control plane and node-level):
- `kubelet` — node agent logs, pod scheduling decisions, volume mount events
- `kube-proxy` — iptables rule updates, service endpoint changes
- `container-runtime` — container start/stop events, image pull logs

**Workload logs** (application stdout/stderr):
- All container stdout and stderr streams are captured and indexed
- Logs are associated with Kubernetes metadata: cluster name, namespace, pod name, container name, and labels

**Querying logs in Log Explorer:**

Navigate to **Logging → Log Explorer** and use these resource filters:

```
resource.type="k8s_container"
resource.labels.cluster_name="gke-cluster-1"
resource.labels.namespace_name="bank-of-anthos"
resource.labels.container_name="frontend"
```

**Useful log queries for Bank of Anthos:**

View all errors across the application:
```
resource.type="k8s_container"
resource.labels.namespace_name="bank-of-anthos"
severity>=ERROR
```

View transaction writes to the ledger:
```
resource.type="k8s_container"
resource.labels.container_name="ledgerwriter"
resource.labels.namespace_name="bank-of-anthos"
```

View JWT authentication events:
```
resource.type="k8s_container"
resource.labels.container_name="userservice"
resource.labels.namespace_name="bank-of-anthos"
```

**Log-based metrics**: Cloud Logging allows you to create custom metrics from log patterns. For example, a count of `severity=ERROR` log entries from `ledgerwriter` can be turned into a Cloud Monitoring metric, enabling alerting on transaction failure rates without any application code changes.

### Cloud Trace

**Cloud Trace** receives distributed traces from ASM sidecars via the Stackdriver exporter configured in the Istio ConfigMap. Every inbound request to the frontend generates a trace that spans all microservice hops.

Navigate to **Trace → Trace List** in the Cloud Console to view traces.

**What a Bank of Anthos trace looks like:**

A payment transaction trace spans:
```
frontend (POST /payment)                     ~45ms total
  └─ ledgerwriter (POST /transactions)       ~30ms
       └─ ledger-db (SQL INSERT)             ~5ms
  └─ balancereader (GET /balances/{id})      ~10ms
       └─ ledger-db (SQL SELECT)             ~3ms
```

This trace shows the complete call graph, the latency contributed by each service, and whether any span returned an error. This is invaluable for identifying which microservice is the bottleneck in a slow request.

**Trace sampling**: ASM samples 100% of traces by default in this configuration. In high-throughput production environments, sampling rates are typically reduced to 1–5% to control cost and storage volume.

**Latency analysis**: The **Trace → Analysis Reports** view aggregates trace data to show latency distributions over time. This allows you to detect latency regressions after deployments — for example, confirming that a new version of `ledgerwriter` did not increase the p99 latency of `/transactions`.

### GKE Security Posture Dashboard

Navigate to **Kubernetes Engine → Security Posture** in the Google Cloud Console to view the security findings generated by the Security Posture feature enabled on each cluster.

**Workload configuration findings**: GKE scans all running pods and reports issues such as:
- Containers running as root
- Missing resource limits
- Containers with `allowPrivilegeEscalation: true`
- Pods without liveness or readiness probes

Because Bank of Anthos implements the `restricted` Pod Security Standards profile (non-root, read-only filesystem, dropped capabilities), most workload findings should be absent or informational, providing a clean baseline to compare against other workloads.

**Vulnerability findings**: GKE scans the OS packages and language dependencies in every running container image and reports CVEs with CVSS scores. Findings are grouped by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and include remediation guidance such as the patched package version.

### Cost Breakdown

Navigate to **Billing → Cost breakdown** and filter by **Label: goog-k8s-cluster-name** to see per-cluster cost attribution. With GKE Cost Management enabled, you can further break down costs by namespace, enabling per-team chargeback visibility.

---

## Hands-On Exercises

The following exercises are designed to deepen a platform engineer's understanding of the features deployed by this module. Each exercise uses only `kubectl` and `gcloud` commands against the running deployment. All exercises are non-destructive unless marked **[Destructive]**.

Before running any exercise, obtain credentials for both clusters:

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials gke-cluster-1 \
  --region us-west1 --project PROJECT_ID

gcloud container clusters get-credentials gke-cluster-2 \
  --region us-east1 --project PROJECT_ID
```

Set shell variables for convenience:

```bash
CTX1="gke_PROJECT_ID_us-west1_gke-cluster-1"
CTX2="gke_PROJECT_ID_us-east1_gke-cluster-2"
NS="bank-of-anthos"
```

---

### Exercise 1: Inspect the Service Mesh

**Goal**: Verify ASM is running and understand sidecar injection.

List all pods in the `bank-of-anthos` namespace and confirm each has two containers — the application container and the Envoy sidecar (`istio-proxy`):

```bash
kubectl get pods -n $NS --context $CTX1 \
  -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{range .spec.containers[*]}{.name}{" "}{end}{"\n"}{end}'
```

Each pod should show two containers, for example:
```
frontend-7d9b8f6c4-xkp2q    frontend istio-proxy
ledgerwriter-6c9b7d5f8-m3vt  ledgerwriter istio-proxy
```

Inspect the Envoy sidecar configuration for the frontend pod:

```bash
FRONTEND_POD=$(kubectl get pod -n $NS --context $CTX1 \
  -l app=frontend -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

kubectl exec -n $NS --context $CTX1 $FRONTEND_POD \
  -c istio-proxy -- pilot-agent request GET config_dump | \
  python3 -m json.tool | grep -A5 '"name": "ledgerwriter"'
```

This shows the Envoy cluster configuration for `ledgerwriter` — the upstream endpoints, load balancing policy, and TLS settings that the sidecar uses when the frontend calls the ledger writer service.

Check the mTLS certificate issued to the frontend pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -n $NS --context $CTX1 $FRONTEND_POD \
  -c istio-proxy -- openssl s_client \
  -connect ledgerwriter.$NS.svc.cluster.local:8080 \
  -showcerts 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -text | \
  grep -A3 "Subject Alternative Name"
```

The SAN field will show the SPIFFE identity of the `ledgerwriter` workload:
```
URI:spiffe://PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog/ns/bank-of-anthos/sa/bank-of-anthos
```

---

### Exercise 2: Enforce a Strict mTLS Policy

**Goal**: Apply a `PeerAuthentication` policy that rejects all non-mTLS traffic to the namespace, then verify it is enforced.

Apply a strict mTLS policy:

```bash
kubectl apply --context $CTX1 -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: strict-mtls
  namespace: bank-of-anthos
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
EOF
```

Attempt to call a service directly without mTLS from outside the mesh (this should fail):

```bash
kubectl run curl-test --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never \
  --context $CTX1 -- \
  curl -s http://userservice.bank-of-anthos.svc.cluster.local:8080/ready
```

Because the `curl-test` pod is not in a mesh-injected namespace, it has no sidecar and cannot establish mTLS. The connection will be reset. Clean up:

```bash
kubectl delete pod curl-test --context $CTX1
kubectl delete peerauthentication strict-mtls -n $NS --context $CTX1
```

**What to observe**: In Cloud Logging, look for Envoy access log entries showing connection resets from the non-mesh pod. In the ASM dashboard, the security panel will show the mTLS policy applied and any policy violations.

---

### Exercise 3: Apply an AuthorizationPolicy

**Goal**: Restrict which services can call `ledgerwriter`, demonstrating zero-trust network policy enforcement at Layer 7.

Apply a policy allowing only the `frontend` service account to reach `ledgerwriter`:

```bash
kubectl apply --context $CTX1 -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: ledgerwriter-allow-frontend
  namespace: bank-of-anthos
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ledgerwriter
  action: ALLOW
  rules:
  - from:
    - source:
        principals:
        - "cluster.local/ns/bank-of-anthos/sa/bank-of-anthos"
EOF
```

Attempt to call `ledgerwriter` from a pod using a different service account — the call should be denied with HTTP 403:

```bash
kubectl run deny-test \
  --image=curlimages/curl \
  --restart=Never \
  --overrides='{"spec":{"serviceAccountName":"default"}}' \
  --context $CTX1 \
  -n $NS -- \
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
  http://ledgerwriter:8080/ready
```

Expected output: `403`

Clean up:

```bash
kubectl delete pod deny-test -n $NS --context $CTX1
kubectl delete authorizationpolicy ledgerwriter-allow-frontend -n $NS --context $CTX1
```

---

### Exercise 4: Traffic Splitting with VirtualService

**Goal**: Simulate a canary deployment by splitting traffic between two versions of a service.

Label existing frontend pods as `version: stable` and create a second Deployment labelled `version: canary`. Then apply a `VirtualService` routing 90% of traffic to stable and 10% to canary:

First, create DestinationRule subsets:

```bash
kubectl apply --context $CTX1 -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: frontend-versions
  namespace: bank-of-anthos
spec:
  host: frontend
  subsets:
  - name: stable
    labels:
      app: frontend
  - name: canary
    labels:
      app: frontend-canary
EOF
```

Apply traffic split:

```bash
kubectl apply --context $CTX1 -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: frontend-split
  namespace: bank-of-anthos
spec:
  hosts:
  - frontend
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: frontend
        subset: stable
      weight: 90
    - destination:
        host: frontend
        subset: canary
      weight: 10
EOF
```

Observe the traffic distribution in the ASM service mesh dashboard — the topology graph will show the 90/10 split on the edge leading into the `frontend` service.

Clean up:

```bash
kubectl delete virtualservice frontend-split -n $NS --context $CTX1
kubectl delete destinationrule frontend-versions -n $NS --context $CTX1
```

---

### Exercise 5: Observe Multi-Cluster Traffic Distribution

**Goal**: Confirm that the global load balancer distributes traffic across both clusters and verify backend health.

Check the backend health of the Multi-Cluster Ingress from the Google Cloud Console:

```bash
gcloud compute backend-services list --global --project PROJECT_ID \
  --filter="name~bank-of-anthos" \
  --format="table(name,backends[].group:label=BACKENDS)"
```

Describe the backend service to see health status per NEG:

```bash
BACKEND=$(gcloud compute backend-services list --global \
  --project PROJECT_ID \
  --filter="name~bank-of-anthos" \
  --format="value(name)" | head -1)

gcloud compute backend-services get-health $BACKEND \
  --global --project PROJECT_ID
```

Each NEG (one per cluster) should report `HEALTHY` backends. If a cluster's pods are unhealthy, the load balancer automatically stops sending traffic to that cluster's NEG.

Scale the frontend Deployment in `cluster2` to zero replicas to simulate a regional failure:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment frontend -n $NS \
  --context $CTX2 --replicas=0
```

Wait approximately 30 seconds, then re-check backend health — `cluster2`'s NEG should show no healthy backends. Run several requests to the application URL and confirm they all succeed (all served by `cluster1`).

Restore cluster2:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment frontend -n $NS \
  --context $CTX2 --replicas=1
```

---

### Exercise 6: Inspect Distributed Traces

**Goal**: Trace a complete payment transaction across all microservices.

Trigger a payment through the load generator or the frontend UI, then navigate to **Trace → Trace List** in the Google Cloud Console. Filter by service `frontend` and select a trace for the `/payment` endpoint.

Alternatively, query traces programmatically:

```bash
gcloud trace traces list \
  --project PROJECT_ID \
  --filter="labels.g.co/agent=~istio" \
  --limit=10
```

In the trace detail view, expand each span to see:
- The HTTP method and path for each service call
- The latency contribution of each microservice
- Any error status codes
- The `x-b3-traceid` header value that links all spans together

The `x-b3-traceid` is propagated by the Envoy sidecar across all hops. Bank of Anthos services are also instrumented to forward the B3 trace headers (`x-b3-traceid`, `x-b3-spanid`, `x-b3-parentspanid`) in their outbound calls, ensuring the full call graph is visible in a single trace.

---

### Exercise 7: Horizontal Pod Autoscaling

**Goal**: Apply a HorizontalPodAutoscaler to the frontend and observe GKE scaling pods in response to load.

```bash
kubectl autoscale deployment frontend \
  -n $NS --context $CTX1 \
  --cpu-percent=50 \
  --min=2 --max=10
```

Watch the HPA status as the load generator drives CPU utilisation:

```bash
kubectl get hpa frontend -n $NS --context $CTX1 --watch
```

When CPU utilisation exceeds 50% of the requested `100m`, the HPA controller increases the replica count. On Autopilot clusters, GKE automatically provisions additional node capacity to accommodate the new pods — no manual node scaling is required.

Clean up:

```bash
kubectl delete hpa frontend -n $NS --context $CTX1
```

---

### Exercise 8: Validate Security Posture Findings

**Goal**: Introduce a misconfigured pod and observe GKE Security Posture detecting it.

Deploy a pod that violates the restricted security profile:

```bash
kubectl apply --context $CTX1 -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: insecure-test
  namespace: bank-of-anthos
  labels:
    app: insecure-test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: test
    image: nginx:latest
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: 0
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: true
EOF
```

Within 1–5 minutes, navigate to **Kubernetes Engine → Security Posture → Workload Configuration** in the Google Cloud Console. The `insecure-test` pod will appear with findings including:
- `Container running as root`
- `Privilege escalation allowed`
- `Missing resource limits`
- `No liveness or readiness probe`

Clean up:

```bash
kubectl delete pod insecure-test -n $NS --context $CTX1
```

**What this demonstrates**: Security Posture catches misconfigurations that slip through CI/CD pipelines, providing a runtime safety net that complements policy enforcement tools like Policy Controller.

### Exercise 9: Mount a Cloud Storage Bucket with GCS FUSE

**Goal**: Use the GCS FUSE CSI driver to mount a Cloud Storage bucket as a filesystem volume inside a pod — demonstrating how workloads can read and write GCS objects without any GCS client library or custom code.

**Step 1 — Create a GCS bucket:**
```bash
gsutil mb -p PROJECT_ID -l us-west1 gs://PROJECT_ID-fuse-demo
echo "Hello from GCS FUSE" > /tmp/hello.txt
gsutil cp /tmp/hello.txt gs://PROJECT_ID-fuse-demo/hello.txt
```

**Step 2 — Grant the Bank of Anthos service account access to the bucket:**
```bash
gsutil iam ch \
  serviceAccount:PROJECT_ID-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com:objectViewer \
  gs://PROJECT_ID-fuse-demo
```

For Standard clusters using Workload Identity, grant access to the GSA instead:
```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
  --member "serviceAccount:PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog[bank-of-anthos/bank-of-anthos]" \
  --role roles/storage.objectViewer
```

**Step 3 — Deploy a pod that mounts the bucket:**
```bash
kubectl apply --context $CTX1 -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gcs-fuse-demo
  namespace: bank-of-anthos
  annotations:
    gke-gcsfuse/volumes: "true"
spec:
  serviceAccountName: bank-of-anthos
  containers:
  - name: reader
    image: busybox
    command: ["sh", "-c", "cat /data/hello.txt && sleep 3600"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: gcs-bucket
      mountPath: /data
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: gcs-bucket
    csi:
      driver: gcsfuse.csi.storage.gke.io
      readOnly: true
      volumeAttributes:
        bucketName: PROJECT_ID-fuse-demo
        mountOptions: "implicit-dirs"
EOF
```

**Step 4 — Verify the mount and read the file:**
```bash
kubectl wait pod gcs-fuse-demo -n $NS --context $CTX1 \
  --for=condition=Ready --timeout=60s

kubectl logs gcs-fuse-demo -n $NS --context $CTX1 -c reader
```

Expected output: `Hello from GCS FUSE`

**Step 5 — Inspect the sidecar injected by the CSI driver:**
```bash
kubectl get pod gcs-fuse-demo -n $NS --context $CTX1 \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].name}'
```

The pod will have two containers: your `reader` container and the `gke-gcsfuse-sidecar` injected automatically by the driver to handle FUSE mounting.

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Cloud Storage → Buckets → PROJECT_ID-fuse-demo** to confirm the file is there. Navigate to **Kubernetes Engine → Workloads → gcs-fuse-demo** to inspect the pod and its volumes.

**Clean up:**
```bash
kubectl delete pod gcs-fuse-demo -n $NS --context $CTX1
gsutil rm -r gs://PROJECT_ID-fuse-demo
```

---

### Exercise 10: Deploy a Service with Gateway API

**Goal**: Use the GKE Gateway API to expose the Bank of Anthos frontend through a `Gateway` and `HTTPRoute` resource — demonstrating the role-oriented traffic model that supersedes Ingress.

**Step 1 — Check available GatewayClasses:**
```bash
kubectl get gatewayclass --context $CTX1
```

You should see `gke-l7-global-external-managed` (global external LB) and `gke-l7-regional-external-managed` (regional LB) at minimum.

**Step 2 — Create a Gateway (provisions a load balancer):**
```bash
kubectl apply --context $CTX1 -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway-api-demo
  namespace: bank-of-anthos
spec:
  gatewayClassName: gke-l7-regional-external-managed
  listeners:
  - name: http
    protocol: HTTP
    port: 80
EOF
```

**Step 3 — Create an HTTPRoute pointing to the frontend service:**
```bash
kubectl apply --context $CTX1 -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: frontend-route
  namespace: bank-of-anthos
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: gateway-api-demo
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /
    backendRefs:
    - name: frontend
      port: 80
EOF
```

**Step 4 — Watch the Gateway provision its IP address:**
```bash
kubectl get gateway gateway-api-demo -n $NS --context $CTX1 --watch
```

When the `ADDRESS` field is populated, the load balancer is ready. This typically takes 1–3 minutes.

**Step 5 — Test the route:**
```bash
GW_IP=$(kubectl get gateway gateway-api-demo -n $NS --context $CTX1 \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://$GW_IP/
```

Expected output: `200`

**Step 6 — Add a header-based routing rule** (not possible with standard Ingress):
```bash
kubectl apply --context $CTX1 -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: frontend-route
  namespace: bank-of-anthos
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: gateway-api-demo
  rules:
  - matches:
    - headers:
      - name: x-debug
        value: "true"
    backendRefs:
    - name: userservice
      port: 8080
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /
    backendRefs:
    - name: frontend
      port: 80
EOF
```

This routes requests carrying the header `x-debug: true` to `userservice`, and all other requests to `frontend` — a routing rule that would require a custom Ingress controller annotation with legacy Ingress.

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Network Services → Load Balancing** to see the load balancer provisioned by the Gateway. Notice it appears alongside the MCI-managed load balancer, demonstrating how multiple ingress mechanisms can coexist.

**Clean up:**
```bash
kubectl delete httproute frontend-route -n $NS --context $CTX1
kubectl delete gateway gateway-api-demo -n $NS --context $CTX1
```

---

### Exercise 11: Verify Workload Identity

**Goal**: Confirm that pods in the mesh are using Workload Identity to authenticate to GCP APIs, and manually verify the token exchange mechanism.

**Step 1 — Inspect the Kubernetes Service Account annotation:**
```bash
kubectl get serviceaccount bank-of-anthos \
  -n $NS --context $CTX1 -o yaml
```

Look for the annotation:
```yaml
annotations:
  iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: gke-workload-development@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

This annotation links the Kubernetes Service Account to a Google Service Account.

**Step 2 — Verify the IAM binding on the GSA:**
```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy \
  gke-workload-development@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format="table(bindings.role,bindings.members)"
```

Look for a binding with role `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` for the member:
`serviceAccount:PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog[bank-of-anthos/bank-of-anthos]`

**Step 3 — Request a token from inside a pod:**
```bash
FRONTEND_POD=$(kubectl get pod -n $NS --context $CTX1 \
  -l app=frontend -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

kubectl exec -n $NS --context $CTX1 $FRONTEND_POD \
  -c frontend -- \
  curl -s -H "Metadata-Flavor: Google" \
  "http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token" \
  | python3 -m json.tool | grep -E "token_type|expires_in"
```

The metadata server returns a short-lived OAuth2 access token. The `token_type` will be `Bearer` and `expires_in` will be approximately 3600 seconds. This token was obtained via Workload Identity — no key file is present anywhere on the pod.

**Step 4 — Confirm no key file is mounted:**
```bash
kubectl exec -n $NS --context $CTX1 $FRONTEND_POD \
  -c frontend -- find / -name "*.json" 2>/dev/null | grep -v proc
```

There should be no JSON credential files. All GCP authentication flows through the metadata server using the Workload Identity token.

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → gke-workload-development** and click the **Permissions** tab to see the Workload Identity binding. Navigate to **IAM & Admin → Workload Identity Pools** to see the pool created for this project's clusters.

---

### Exercise 12: Enable Workload Metrics with PodMonitoring

**Goal**: Configure Managed Service for Prometheus to scrape a custom `/metrics` endpoint from one of the Bank of Anthos services, making workload-level Prometheus metrics available in Cloud Monitoring.

The `frontend` service exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics at `/metrics` on port 8080. By default, Managed Prometheus does not scrape these — a `PodMonitoring` resource must be created to register the scrape target.

**Step 1 — Verify the metrics endpoint is live:**
```bash
FRONTEND_POD=$(kubectl get pod -n $NS --context $CTX1 \
  -l app=frontend -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

kubectl exec -n $NS --context $CTX1 $FRONTEND_POD \
  -c frontend -- curl -s http://localhost:8080/metrics | head -20
```

You should see Prometheus exposition format output with metric names prefixed by the service name.

**Step 2 — Create a PodMonitoring resource:**
```bash
kubectl apply --context $CTX1 -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: monitoring.googleapis.com/v1
kind: PodMonitoring
metadata:
  name: frontend-metrics
  namespace: bank-of-anthos
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  endpoints:
  - port: 8080
    path: /metrics
    interval: 30s
EOF
```

**Step 3 — Confirm the PodMonitoring resource is active:**
```bash
kubectl get podmonitoring frontend-metrics \
  -n $NS --context $CTX1 -o yaml | grep -A5 "status:"
```

The `status.conditions` field will show `ConfigurationCreateSuccess` when the scrape target is registered.

**Step 4 — Query metrics in Cloud Monitoring:**

Allow 2–3 minutes for the first scrape cycle, then navigate to **Monitoring → Metrics Explorer** in the Google Cloud Console. Set:
- **Resource type**: `prometheus_target`
- **Metric**: search for a metric beginning with `prometheus.googleapis.com/`

Alternatively, use PromQL in the Metrics Explorer:
```
rate(prometheus_googleapis_com:python_gc_collections_total{namespace="bank-of-anthos"}[5m])
```

**Step 5 — Extend to all services:**

To scrape all Bank of Anthos services simultaneously, use a `ClusterPodMonitoring` resource that matches across the namespace:
```bash
kubectl apply --context $CTX1 -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: monitoring.googleapis.com/v1
kind: ClusterPodMonitoring
metadata:
  name: bank-of-anthos-all
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/part-of: bank-of-anthos
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
    - bank-of-anthos
  endpoints:
  - port: 8080
    path: /metrics
    interval: 30s
EOF
```

**Explore in the Console**: Navigate to **Monitoring → Dashboards → Prometheus Overview** to see a list of all active scrape targets. Each pod matching the `PodMonitoring` selector should appear as a target with `UP` status.

**Clean up:**
```bash
kubectl delete podmonitoring frontend-metrics -n $NS --context $CTX1
kubectl delete clusterpodmonitoring bank-of-anthos-all --context $CTX1
```

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Application Not Reachable After Deployment

**Symptom**: Navigating to the `boa.GLOBAL_IP.sslip.io` URL returns a connection error or 502.

**Most likely cause**: The managed TLS certificate is still being provisioned. Certificate provisioning takes 10–60 minutes after the load balancer is created. During this window, HTTPS requests fail.

**Check certificate status**:
```bash
kubectl get managedcertificate -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1
```

The `STATUS` column should progress from `Provisioning` to `Active`. Until it shows `Active`, HTTPS traffic will not work.

**Also check**: load balancer backend health. Navigate to **Network Services → Load Balancing** in the Cloud Console and inspect the backend service. If backends show `Unhealthy`, the pods may not be ready yet, or the health check firewall rule (`allow-health-checks`) may be missing.

---

### Pods Stuck in `Pending` State

**Symptom**: Pods remain in `Pending` state after the application is deployed.

**On Autopilot clusters**: Autopilot provisions nodes on demand. The first pod scheduled to a new node profile can take 2–3 minutes to start while Autopilot provisions the node. This is expected behaviour. Watch pod events:

```bash
kubectl describe pod POD_NAME -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 | tail -20
```

Look for `TriggeredScaleUp` events confirming Autopilot is provisioning capacity.

**On Standard clusters**: Check if nodes are Ready and have sufficient allocatable resources:

```bash
kubectl get nodes --context $CTX1
kubectl describe node NODE_NAME --context $CTX1 | grep -A10 "Allocatable"
```

If nodes are `NotReady`, check kubelet logs via **Logging → Log Explorer** filtering on `resource.type="k8s_node"`.

---

### Sidecar Not Injected Into Pods

**Symptom**: Pods show only one container instead of two (application + `istio-proxy`). mTLS calls fail.

**Check the namespace label**:
```bash
kubectl get namespace bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1 \
  -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels}'
```

The label `istio.io/rev=asm-managed` must be present. If missing, re-label the namespace:

```bash
kubectl label namespace bank-of-anthos \
  istio.io/rev=asm-managed --context $CTX1 --overwrite
```

Note: re-labelling the namespace does not inject sidecars into existing pods. Existing pods must be restarted to receive injection:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1
```

**Check ASM is configured on the cluster**:
```bash
gcloud container fleet mesh describe --project PROJECT_ID
```

If the cluster does not appear in `membershipStates`, ASM provisioning may still be in progress. Allow up to 20 minutes after fleet registration.

---

### MultiClusterIngress Not Routing Traffic

**Symptom**: The global load balancer IP is reachable but returns 502 or routes to only one cluster.

**Check MCI resource status**:
```bash
kubectl describe multiclusteringress bank-of-anthos-mci \
  -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1
```

Look for events showing backend service creation. The MCI controller logs can be found by filtering Cloud Logging for `resource.type="k8s_cluster"` and searching for `multiclusteringress`.

**Verify the MultiClusterService has backends**:
```bash
kubectl describe multiclusterservice bank-of-anthos-mcs \
  -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1
```

Each cluster listed in the `spec.clusters` field should show a corresponding NEG being created.

**Check the config cluster designation**:
```bash
gcloud container fleet features describe multiclusteringress \
  --project PROJECT_ID
```

The `configMembership` field must point to `cluster1`. If it is empty or points to a different cluster, MCI resources applied to `cluster1` will be ignored.

---

### Fleet Membership Not Reaching READY State

**Symptom**: Deployment stalls waiting for fleet membership to become `READY`.

**Check current membership state**:
```bash
gcloud container fleet memberships list --project PROJECT_ID
```

If state is `REGISTERING` for more than 10 minutes, check whether the required APIs are enabled:
```bash
gcloud services list --enabled --project PROJECT_ID \
  --filter="name:(gkehub OR gkeconnect OR anthos)"
```

All three should be listed. If not, enable them:
```bash
gcloud services enable gkehub.googleapis.com \
  gkeconnect.googleapis.com anthos.googleapis.com \
  --project PROJECT_ID
```

Also verify the GKE Hub service account has the `roles/gkehub.serviceAgent` role:
```bash
gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID \
  --flatten="bindings[].members" \
  --filter="bindings.role=roles/gkehub.serviceAgent"
```

---

### ASM Sidecar Causing Pod Startup Failures

**Symptom**: Pods fail to start with errors like `connection refused` on application startup, even before the application has initialised.

**Cause**: The Envoy sidecar initialises asynchronously. If the application container starts before the sidecar is ready and immediately makes an outbound network call, the call fails because iptables rules have been set but the sidecar is not yet listening.

**Solution**: Add a `holdApplicationUntilProxyStarts` annotation or configure a startup delay. For Java services (which have slow JVM startup), this is less common because the JVM itself takes several seconds. For fast-starting containers, configure the sidecar to hold application traffic:

```bash
kubectl annotate pod POD_NAME \
  proxy.istio.io/config='{"holdApplicationUntilProxyStarts": true}' \
  -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1
```

For a permanent fix, apply the annotation at the Deployment level in the pod template spec.

---

### VPC Deletion Fails on Destroy

**Symptom**: Teardown fails with `resource is in use by resource` when attempting to delete the VPC or subnets.

**Cause**: GKE and the MCI controller create firewall rules and Network Endpoint Groups during cluster operation that are not managed by this module's resource tracking. These must be cleaned up before the VPC can be deleted.

**Manual cleanup**:

Delete GKE-managed firewall rules:
```bash
gcloud compute firewall-rules list \
  --project PROJECT_ID \
  --filter="name~^gke-.* AND name~.*-mcsd$" \
  --format="value(name)" | \
  xargs -I{} gcloud compute firewall-rules delete {} \
    --project PROJECT_ID --quiet
```

Delete orphaned NEGs:
```bash
for ZONE in $(gcloud compute zones list --project PROJECT_ID \
  --format="value(name)"); do
  gcloud compute network-endpoint-groups list \
    --project PROJECT_ID --zones=$ZONE \
    --filter="name~^gsmrsvd.*" \
    --format="value(name)" | \
    xargs -I{} gcloud compute network-endpoint-groups delete {} \
      --project PROJECT_ID --zone=$ZONE --quiet
done
```

After completing manual cleanup, re-run the destroy operation.

---

### Checking Overall Cluster and Mesh Health

Use these commands as a quick health check after deployment:

```bash
# All pods running in bank-of-anthos namespace on both clusters
kubectl get pods -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1
kubectl get pods -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX2

# Fleet membership status
gcloud container fleet memberships list --project PROJECT_ID

# ASM mesh status
gcloud container fleet mesh describe --project PROJECT_ID

# MCI and MCS status
kubectl get multiclusteringress,multiclusterservice \
  -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1

# Managed certificate status
kubectl get managedcertificate -n bank-of-anthos --context $CTX1

# Global load balancer backend health
gcloud compute backend-services list --global --project PROJECT_ID \
  --filter="name~bank-of-anthos" --format="value(name)" | \
  xargs -I{} gcloud compute backend-services get-health {} \
    --global --project PROJECT_ID
```
