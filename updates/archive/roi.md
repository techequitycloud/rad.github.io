# ROI Calculator

The **ROI (Return on Investment) Calculator** helps you estimate the potential savings and value generated by using the platform's automated modules compared to manual provisioning.

## How it Works

The calculator typically considers factors such as:
*   **Time Savings:** How many hours are saved per deployment by using automation?
*   **Labor Cost:** The average hourly rate of an engineer.
*   **Frequency:** How many deployments you perform per month.
*   **Error Reduction:** Estimated savings from avoiding manual errors and rework.

## How to Use

1.  Navigate to the **ROI** page.
2.  Enter your estimated values in the input fields (e.g., "Hourly Rate", "Deployments per Month").
3.  The calculator will dynamically update to show:
    *   **Monthly Savings:** Estimated money saved per month.
    *   **Annual Savings:** Estimated money saved per year.
    *   **Time Saved:** Total engineering hours reclaimed.

Use these figures to justify the platform adoption or to understand the value of your credit purchases.
