## Step 1: Manage Users

3.  To add a new user, you can invite them through the **Help** page.

## Step 2: Assign and Change User Roles

Roles determine what a user can see and do on the platform.

1.  In the **"User Credits"** tab, find the user you want to modify and click the **"Edit"** button.
2.  In the user details modal, you can change a user's status:

    -   **Partner Status:** Grant or revoke partner privileges.
    -   **Activate/Deactivate Account:** Temporarily disable or enable a user's account.

## Step 3: Adjust Credit Balances

You can manually add or remove credits from a user's balance.

1.  In the user edit modal, you can modify the **"Awarded"** or **"Purchased"** credit balances.

    -   **Awarded Credits:** Typically used for grants, promotions, or testing.
    -   **Purchased Credits:** Credits that a user has bought or received from a subscription.

2.  Enter the new credit amount and click **"Save"**.

## Step 4: Use the Partner Credits Feature

The Partner Credits feature allows you to grant a recurring monthly credit allowance to specific users.

1.  In the user edit modal, find the **"Partner"** field.
2.  Enter the number of credits you want to grant this user each month.
3.  This amount will be automatically added to the user's balance on the 1st of every month.
