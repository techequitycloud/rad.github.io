## 1. Partner Modules

As a partner, you can deploy modules from the public "Platform Modules" catalog as well as from your own private GitHub repository. Your exclusive modules will appear under the "Partner Modules" tab on the module selection page.

### 1.1. Deploying a Module

- From the **Deployments** page, click the **Create New** button.
- Select the **Partner Modules** tab.
- Browse the available modules. Each module card displays its name, a brief description, and the credit cost to deploy it.
- Click on the card of the module you wish to deploy.

### 1.2. Configuring the Deployment

After selecting a module, you will be taken to the provisioning page, where you need to configure the deployment.

- **Configuration Form:** A form will be displayed with a series of fields. These are the variables required to deploy the module, such as project IDs, regions, or other specific settings.
- **Fill out the Form:** Complete all the required fields with the appropriate information for your deployment.
- **Submit:** Once you have filled out the form, click the **Submit** button. The application will display module dependencies and validate your inputs and, if your credit balance is sufficient, begin the deployment process.

You will be redirected back to the **Deployments** page, where you can monitor the status of your new deployment.

## 2. Configuring Your GitHub Repository

To make your private modules available for deployment, you must first configure your GitHub repository in your profile.

- **Navigate to Profile:** Go to your profile page.
- **Provide a GitHub Token:** In the "Partner Settings" section, enter a GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope.
- **Select the Repository:** Once the token is saved, you can select your private repository from the dropdown list.

The modules from this repository will now appear under the "Partner Modules" tab on the deployment page, visible only to you.

## 3. Publishing Modules

The "Publish" tab allows you to select and publish modules from your configured GitHub repository, making them available for deployment.

### 3.1. The Publish Tab

The publish tab displays a list of modules available for publishing from your configured GitHub repository. It also shows a list of modules that have already been published.

### 3.2. Publishing a Module

- Select the modules you wish to publish by clicking on their names.
- Click the **Publish** (or **Update**) button.

The selected modules will now be available for deployment under the "Partner Modules" tab.

### 3.3. Syncing Logic

The system includes a safeguard to ensure that any modules that no longer exist in your Git repository are removed from the "Deploy" tab. This is particularly important when you change your configured repository URL.

## 4. Billing

As a partner, you have access to the **Billing** page to manage your credits and subscriptions.

### 4.1. Subscription Tiers

This tab displays all available subscription tiers. You can subscribe to a tier to receive a recurring amount of credits.

### 4.2. Buy Credits

This tab provides a simple interface for making one-time credit purchases through Stripe.

### 4.3. Credit Transactions

This tab provides a detailed history of all your credit transactions, including additions from subscriptions or purchases, and deductions from module deployments.

### 4.4. Project Costs

This tab shows you the ongoing costs associated with your deployed projects.

### 4.5. Monthly Invoices

Here you can view and download your monthly invoices.

## 5. Help and Support

The **Help** page is your central resource for documentation and support. It contains:

- **User Guides:** Access to the Admin, Partner, Agent, and User guides.
- **Support Form:** A form to send a message directly to the support team.

## 6. Theme Customization

You can switch between light and dark themes to suit your preference. The theme selector is located in the user menu in the top-right corner of the navigation bar.
