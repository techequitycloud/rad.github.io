# My Referral Revenue

**My Referral Revenue** refers to the commission or revenue share earned by **Agents** for referring users to the platform.

## Understanding Referral Revenue

*   **Source:** Revenue is generated when a user *referred by you* spends credits on the platform.
*   **Calculation:** Typically a percentage of the "True Revenue" (paid credits) spent by your referrals.
*   **Tracking:** The platform links users to you via a referral code.

## Viewing Referral Revenue

Please refer to the **[User Revenue](billing-user-revenue.md)** documentation. For Agents, the "User Revenue" tab is customized to show:
1.  **Your Referrals:** A list of users linked to your account.
2.  **Revenue:** The spending activity of those specific users.

By filtering the **User Revenue** tab, you can track exactly how much your referrals are spending and calculate your expected commission.
