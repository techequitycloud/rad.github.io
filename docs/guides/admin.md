## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Administrator Guide for the Rapid Application Deployment (RAD) platform. As an administrator, you have full control over the platform's configuration, user management, billing, and deployment oversight. This guide will walk you through your key responsibilities and the tools available to you.

## 2. Platform Setup & Global Configuration

The **Setup Menu** is your command center for configuring the platform's behavior. It is a one-time setup wizard that can be revisited whenever you need to change global settings.

### 2.1. Accessing Settings
Navigate to the **Setup Menu** link in the main navigation bar.

### 2.2. Key Configurations

*   **Deployment Scope:** Decide whether the platform operates at the Google Cloud **Organization** level or within a specific **Folder**. This determines the scope of data visible in reports and the target for deployments.
*   **Features:** Enable or disable major modules:
    *   **Enable Credits:** Turns on the credit-based cost management system.
    *   **Enable Subscription:** (Requires Credits) Activates the subscription tier system and Stripe integration.
    *   **Private Mode:**
        *   **Enabled:** Partners see *all* deployment data (like an admin). New users must be manually added to the Google Group.
        *   **Disabled (Default):** Partners only see their own data. New users can self-register.
*   **Notification Settings:** Configure the SMTP server settings and the "Support Email" address to enable email notifications for system events.
*   **Cleanup & Retention:** Set a **Retention Period** (e.g., 90 days) and a **Cleanup Schedule** (e.g., Daily) to automatically delete old deployment records and artifacts, helping you manage storage costs.

### 2.3. Jules AI Configuration
To enable the AI-powered module refinement features for yourself and the platform:
1.  Navigate to your **Profile** page (click your avatar in the top right).
2.  Scroll down to the **Admin Settings** section.
3.  Enter your **Jules API Key** and click Save.
4.  This enables the "Jules Refinement" tool on module cards, allowing you to use AI to improve Terraform code.

### 2.4. Platform Repository
Also in the **Admin Settings** section of your Profile:
*   Configure the **Platform GitHub Token** and **Platform GitHub Repository**.
*   This repository serves as the source for "Platform Modules" available to all users.

## 3. User Management

Manage your platform's users from the **Users** page (accessible via the main navigation).

### 3.1. Managing Users
*   **View Users:** See a searchable, paginated list of all registered users.
*   **Activate/Deactivate:** Toggle the "Active" checkbox to grant or revoke login access. Deactivating a user removes them from all access groups.
*   **Assign Roles:**
    *   **User:** Standard access to deploy platform modules.
    *   **Partner:** Grants access to the "Publish" tab for deploying private modules.
    *   **Agent:** Grants access to revenue reporting tools for referred users.
    *   **Finance:** Grants access to financial reports and invoices in the Billing section.
*   **Note:** Admin accounts are marked with a badge and cannot be modified or deactivated through this interface to prevent accidental lockouts.

## 4. Credit & Billing Management

The **Billing** page is your financial hub. As an admin (or Finance user), you see comprehensive data for the entire platform.

### 4.1. Subscription Tiers
*   Go to the **Subscription Tiers** tab.
*   **Create**, **Edit**, and **Delete** subscription packages.
*   Define the Name, Price, Stripe Price ID, and Credit amount for each tier.

### 4.2. Credit Settings
*   **Credit Settings:** Configure the economic model:
    *   **Price Per Credit:** Exchange rate (e.g., 100 credits = $1).
    *   **Sign-up Credits:** Free credits for new users.
    *   **Global Adjustments:** Grant/remove credits from *all* users.
*   **Credit Management:** A dedicated table to manually adjust the "Awarded" or "Purchased" credit balance for individual users.

### 4.3. Financial Reports
*   **Project Costs:** Analyze historical spending trends across all deployments.
*   **Module Revenue:** See which modules are generating the most "true revenue" (paid for with purchased credits).
*   **User Revenue:** Track revenue generated by specific users.
*   **Agent Revenue:** Monitor commissions and revenue driven by your Agents.
*   **Project Invoices:** View and export monthly cost breakdowns for every project.

## 5. Managing Deployments

You have complete visibility into all activity on the platform.

*   **All vs. My Deployments:** The **Deployments** page has tabs to view "All Deployments" (everyone's activity) or just "My Deployments" (your own).
*   **Search:** Use the search bar to find deployments by Name, Deployment ID, or User Email.
*   **Ratings:** View the 1-5 star ratings given by users to gauge user satisfaction with specific modules.
*   **Logs & Debugging:** Click on any Deployment ID to view its full build logs, status history, and configuration variables.

## 6. Publishing Platform Modules

You are responsible for the catalog of standard modules available to all users.

1.  **Configure Repo:** Ensure your Platform GitHub Repository is configured in your **Profile** (see section 2.4).
2.  **Publish:** Go to the **Publish** page. You will see a list of modules found in your repo.
3.  **Refining Modules with Jules:** Click the **Sparkles** icon on any module card to open the Jules AI Refinement tool. Jules can help you improve code, add documentation, or fix bugs before publishing.
4.  **Select & Save:** Select the modules you want to make public and click "Publish" (or "Update"). These will immediately appear on the "Deploy" page for all users.

## 7. Support

Use the **Help** page to:
*   **Send Messages:** Broadcast messages to all users or specific groups via the "Send Message" form.
*   **Invite Users:** Send email invitations to new users via the "Invite User" form.
*   **Manage Documentation:** Ensure your users have access to the latest guides.
