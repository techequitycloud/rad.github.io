# Agent Guide

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Agent Program! As an Agent, you earn commissions by referring new users to the platform. This guide explains how to track your referrals and monitor the revenue they generate.

## 2. Referring Users

1.  **Get Your Link:** Go to the **Help** page and select the **Support** tab.
    *   *Note: This feature is only visible if enabled by the administrator.*
2.  **Invite User:** You will see your unique **Referral Link** (e.g., `?ref=YOUR_ID`) and a QR code.
3.  **Share:** Send this link to potential users. When they sign up using your link, they are automatically linked to your account as a "Referred User".

## 3. Tracking Revenue

Your revenue dashboard is located on the **Revenue** page (click "Revenue" in the top navigation). You have access to two special tabs to monitor your earnings.

### 3.1. Understanding Your Commission
Your earnings are based on the **Agent Revenue Share** percentage configured by the administrator. This percentage is applied to the **True Revenue** generated by your referred users.

*   **True Revenue:** This is defined as the cost of deployments that are paid for using **Purchased Credits** (credits bought with real money via Stripe).
*   **Excluded:** Costs paid for using free "Awarded Credits" (e.g., sign-up bonuses, referral awards) do NOT generate revenue commission.

### 3.2. User Revenue Tab
This detailed report shows you exactly *who* is generating revenue.
*   **Filters:** Filter by specific users (multiselect) and date range.
*   **Data Points:** View the User Email, Module Name, Created At date, Credit Cost, and the **Revenue** generated.
*   **Commission:** The revenue shown here is your calculated share based on the Agent Revenue Share percentage.

### 3.3. Module Revenue Tab
This report gives you a view of *what* is selling across your referrals.
*   **Filters:** Filter by Module Name and date range.
*   **Data Points:** View Module Name, Created At date, Credit Cost, and Revenue.
*   **Insight:** Use this to understand which products are most popular among your referrals so you can focus your marketing efforts.

### 3.4. Accessing Features
As an Agent, your primary workspace is the **Revenue** dashboard. If you are also a registered **User** or **Partner**, you will see additional tabs (like Deployments or Publish) in your navigation bar alongside your agent tools.
