# Module Revenue

**Module Revenue** refers to the income generated by specific modules. This data is primarily used by **Partners** (who own the modules) and **Finance** teams to track performance and calculate payouts.

## Understanding Module Revenue

*   **Source:** Revenue is generated when a user deploys a module that has a configured "Credit Cost".
*   **Calculation:** `Revenue = Deployments × Module Price`.
*   **Visibility:**
    *   **Partners:** See revenue for *their* modules.
    *   **Finance/Admin:** See revenue for *all* modules.

## Viewing Module Revenue

Please refer to the **[Partner Revenue](billing-partner-revenue.md)** documentation for instructions on how to access and filter this data in the Billing section. The "Partner Revenue" tab provides the detailed breakdown of revenue by module.
