## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Agent Program! As an Agent, you earn commissions by referring new users to the platform. This guide explains how to track your referrals and monitor the revenue they generate.

## 2. Referring Users

1.  **Get Your Link:** Go to the **Help** page and select the **Support** tab.
    *   *Note: The referral feature is only visible if referrals are enabled by the administrator.*
2.  **Invite User:** You will see your unique **Referral Link** (e.g., `?ref=YOUR_ID`) along with a **QR Code** that others can scan to sign up through your referral.
3.  **Share:** You can share your referral link in several ways:
    *   Click the **Copy** button to copy the link to your clipboard.
    *   Use the **Share** button to share via your device's native share options (e.g., email, messaging apps).
    *   Show the QR code directly to someone for them to scan.
4.  **Track Progress:** The referral card displays your current referral count against your monthly limit (e.g., "3 of 10 referrals used"). A warning appears when you reach 75% of your limit. If your administrator has configured unlimited referrals, an "Unlimited" badge is displayed instead.
5.  When a new user signs up using your link, they are automatically linked to your account as a "Referred User".

## 3. Tracking Revenue

Your revenue dashboard is located on the **Revenue** page (click "Revenue" in the top navigation). You have access to two tabs to monitor your earnings.

### 3.1. Understanding Your Commission
Your earnings are based on the **Agent Revenue Share** percentage configured by the administrator. This percentage is applied to the **True Revenue** generated by your referred users.

*   **True Revenue:** This is defined as the cost of deployments that are paid for using **Purchased Credits** (credits bought with real money via Stripe or Flutterwave).
*   **Excluded:** Costs paid for using free "Awarded Credits" (e.g., sign-up bonuses, referral awards) do NOT generate revenue commission.

### 3.2. My Referral Revenue Tab
This detailed report shows you exactly *who* is generating revenue among your referred users.
*   **Filters:** Filter by specific users (multiselect) and date range.
*   **Data Points:** View the User Email, Module Name, Created At date, Credit Cost, and the **Revenue** generated.
*   **Commission:** The revenue shown here is your calculated share based on the Agent Revenue Share percentage.

### 3.3. Module Revenue Tab
This report gives you a view of *what* is selling across your referrals.
*   **Filters:** Filter by Module Name and date range.
*   **Data Points:** View Module Name, Created At date, Credit Cost, and Revenue.
*   **Insight:** Use this to understand which products are most popular among your referrals so you can focus your marketing efforts.

### 3.4. Accessing Features
As an Agent, your primary workspace is the **Revenue** dashboard. Your navigation bar shows **Revenue** and **Help**. If you are also assigned the **User** or **Partner** role, you will see additional navigation items (like Deployments, Credits, or Publish) alongside your agent tools.

## 4. Help & Support

Visit the **Help** page for additional resources:

*   **Support Tab:** Access the referral invitation tool and contact support if you need assistance.
*   **Platform Demos Tab:** View demonstrations of platform features.
*   **Platform Workflows Tab:** Browse documented platform workflows.
*   **Platform Guides Tab:** Access user guides and documentation.
