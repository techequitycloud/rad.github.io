    *   **Amount:** The number of credits added or deducted.
    *   **Balance:** The total credit balance after the transaction.
    *   **Description:** Context about the transaction (e.g., "Deployment of module X", "Monthly Subscription").
*   **Search & Filter:** Find specific transactions by date or description.
*   **Export:** Download your transaction history as a CSV file.

## How to Use
