# Support & Resources

Welcome to the RAD Platform support resources. This page provides information on how to get help, report issues, and access additional resources.

## Getting Help

The platform includes a built-in Help page accessible from the main navigation with user guides providing quick access to role-specific guides, a support form to send messages directly to the support team, and user invitation capabilities for partners and admins.

## Reporting Issues

### Deployment Issues

If you encounter problems with a deployment, check deployment logs by clicking on the deployment ID, review your configuration parameters, ensure required resources and permissions exist, and copy exact error messages. Contact support with the deployment ID, module name, error message, configuration parameters (remove sensitive data), and screenshots if applicable.

### Billing Issues

For credit or billing problems, review your transaction history, verify payments were processed through Stripe, check your current credit balance, and contact support with transaction IDs, payment confirmation numbers, screenshots, and a description of expected vs. actual behavior.

### Technical Issues

For platform bugs or technical problems, try to reproduce the issue consistently, document the exact steps that cause the problem, and collect information including browser and version, operating system, screenshots or screen recordings, and console error messages (F12 in most browsers).
