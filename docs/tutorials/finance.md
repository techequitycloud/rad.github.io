3.  Click **Edit** on the user's row.
4.  Update the **Awarded** or **Purchased** balance as needed.
5.  Click **Save** to apply the changes instantly.

## 4. Step 3: Analyze Revenue & Costs
The platform provides detailed reports on where money is coming from and where it is being spent.

3.  **User Revenue:** Track revenue generated by individual users.

## 5. Step 4: Review Invoices
For end-of-month reporting, you can access consolidated invoices.
